        "content": "ESG Report -20196 7 Fahad Al-Sudairi President and CEO It is with great pleasure to welcome you to our inaugural ESG Report for the year 2019. We believe that disclosing our figures and performance with our stakeholders is vital to promote transparency, integrity, operational excellence, and most importantly, our efforts in integrating sustainability in all our business-related matters, for the aim of reducing our ecological footprint and contributing to our communities. \u201dWe are deeply committed to supporting the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030 by enabling a stronger, cleaner and more diverse power energy sector as well as a reliable, efficient, and smart grid. \u201d To be in harmony with the global partnership towards a sustainable planet, we align our ESG strategy with the Saudi Vision 2030 and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) to support the Kingdom in achieving the objectives of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement, and the United Nations Environment Program. Thus, we have committed ourselves to demonstrate performance on 22 ESG material issues and contribute to the achievement of nine of the 17 SDGs, in addition to adopting green investment and green financing options. On the environmental level, we had many achievements in 2019 that express our diligent focus on renewable clean energy options and reducing the carbon foot print of our operations through continuous modernization and optimization of our portfolio. Launching Sakaka Solar PV was a remarkable milestone in the renewable energy integration journey at SEC. Furthermore, we have given the private sector the chance to contribute to electricity generation in the Kingdom through IPP/IWPP and renewable energy projects. Receiving KSA Award for Environmental Management in the Islamic World, serves as a recognition of our innovative environmental management. \u201dWe continue to provide a safe, reliable and efficient power supply to KSA economy where the needs for a strong and a growing economy is optimally balanced with the need for a sound and a cleaner environment for the present and future generations\u201d.  While being the largest electric energy system in the MENA region, SEC has been contributing to the Kingdom\u2019s economy in many ways. In 2019, we have generated a revenue growth of %30 compared to 2016, with a net profit of SAR 1,388 million. We are serving 9.7 million customers across the Kingdom with electricity and thereby powering the nation. Building an agile, inclusive and sustainable workforce is one of our ultimate goals, and more than %92 of our +33,000 employees are Saudi nationals, which can be considered an important factor in catalyzing the economic development in Saudi Arabia. Hence, we invest generously in our employees\u2019 development, well-being and safety through our four preparatory training institutes available within SEC\u2019s premises and the various training programs who delivered more than 977,000 hours of training in 2019. We also continuously update our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics to ensure we cover all topics related to human rights, inclusion and diversity. We lay a great emphasis on innovation and technological applications as they are perceived as the cornerstone of our excellency and the tool that will enable us to compete boldly with the international benchmarks in the electric power industry, fulfilling our environmental goals. Some of our 2019 highlights in this domain was automating SEC\u2019s power grid and integrating smart meters in it for further efficiency, reliability and smart energy deployment. E-bill services and \u2018Hesabi\u2019 platform are also great examples on the digitization of our customer service and transforming to a customer-centric model at SEC, since customer experience one an underlying factor for performance excellence that is one of the focus areas in our strategic direction for the upcoming 5 years. With technology comes cybersecurity and systems protection, to ensure our cyber-resiliency of our systems and customers\u2019 data privacy through upgrading our operational systems and increasing our employees\u2019 awareness on cybersecurity topics.I believe that what we have done so far at SEC is a tremendous success for SEC family, and for our beloved country Saudi Arabia. But, while we keep raising the bar for ourselves, we know that there is still more opportunities to delve in, more improvements to be employed and much more successes to be attained. And all this will be achievable with the support and trust we get from our stakeholders who have an intrinsic role in SEC\u2019s growth journey. CEO MessageESG Report -2019 [102-14] [102-14]",

        "content": "History In 1975, the Government created the Ministry of Industry and Electricity in order to organize and regulate the electricity sector in the Kingdom. In 2003, the Ministry of Industry and Electricity was replaced by the Ministry of Water and Electricity and then, in respect of the electricity sector, by the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources. As part of this initiative, the Kingdom was divided into five operating regions (the Western, Eastern, Central, Southern and Northern Regions). Within each of the Western, Eastern, Central and Southern Regions, the various private and semi-private electricity companies that had previously provided electricity were consolidated into four majority state-owned utilities known collectively as the Saudi Consolidated Electricity Companies (SCECOs). SEC later reduced the number of operating regions to four. As of the date of this report, these regions are the Western Region (consisting of four electricity departments covering Makkah, Jeddah Madinah, Tabuk and Taif), the Eastern Region (consisting of four electricity departments covering Dammam and Al Ahsa, the Northern province, the Al-Jouf province and the northern border), the Central Region (consisting of six electricity departments covering Riyadh city and the Riyadh, Qassim, Alkharj, Dawadme and Hail provinces) and the Southern Region (consisting of four electricity departments covering the Asir, Jizan, Najran and Baha provinces). Within the Northern Region, the General Electricity Corporation (GEC) was given responsibility for supervising the electricity companies operating within that region.A subsequent reform of the electricity sector resulted in the formation of one Saudi Electricity Company (SEC), which was incorporated as a joint stock company in 2000, with its headquarters located in Riyadh. Following the formation of SEC, GEC was dissolved and the four SCECOs, GEC\u2019s projects and the various electricity companies in the Northern region operating under the supervision of GEC were merged into SEC and SEC assumed all of their operations, rights and liabilities.Saudi Electricity Company At A Glance[102-4, [102-5], [102-6]",

The reform was implemented to ensure the stability of supply and a viable electricity sector. The increased tariffs in 2018 primarily impacted the residential and commercial customers, whereby the increase 260% price increase of the lowest slab rate in the residential segment affected more than 97% of our customers. The demand response to these higher tariffs resulted in plateauing consumption trend over the period 2016-2019.Hence, SEC has been working with its stakeholders to develop a sustainable electricity sector in the Kingdom. We have taken a number of measures, including the development of a smart grid, improvement of fuel efficiency, automated customer services and enhanced management of our workforce. A key enabler of the sector\u2019s sustainability and efficiency in alignment with the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030 was the establishment of a balancing fund, which is intended to cover any fiscal deficit in the system in a transparent and efficient manner. Within this context, in January 2020, SEC announced it has received a correspondence from Ministry of Finance stating that a first step of the balancing account of the electricity sector has been effected starting from the fiscal year 2019. The balancing account is a regulatory reform which aims to achieve a fiscal balance for the electricity sector by covering the difference between required operating revenue for SEC and its actual operating revenues from the applicable tariff. Going forward, the government authorities are expected to decide on the required operating revenue of SEC on an annual basis as per a revenue cap model. Hence, this balancing account is an important additional step in the right path of the regulatory reforms undertaken by the government towards the sector and SEC since 2016. We also established the Saudi Company for Power Purchase, which is a new entity within the SEC Group that serves as the main purchaser of fuel and represents SEC in signing power purchase agreements with new power generations projects. Based on these circumstances, we formulated our strategic goals and ambitions for the upcoming years. Our main strategic ambition is to be a smart, efficient and customer centric organization. This transition will be driven by a number of key enablers, including digitization efforts, talent development, research and innovation as well as cost optimization, amongst others.

As the main energy supplier in Saudi Arabia, we understand that our operations affect the environment and that we have a strategic role to play in terms of achieving the Kingdom\u2019s ambitions towards clean energy. Therefore, we work closely with the local authorities on a number of initiatives, such as the Flexible Energy Campaign of the Ministerial Council for Clean Energy coordinated by the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Energy\u2019s gas use initiative as well as an air quality study covering the Kingdom\u2019s main cities under the supervision of the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture. We also participate in the Ministry of Energy\u2019s National Committee for Clean Development Mechanism and are a member of the Society for Environmental Protection and Sustainable Development. Our approach to reduce our carbon footprint is focused on addressing climate change through actions and measures aimed at diversifying the electricity generation and fuel mix into a cleaner portfolio consistent with the national energy strategy priorities. In an effort to enhance the reliance on clean energy, we continuously increased the power production from high-efficiency combined cycle, which depends on the use of exhaust heat from gas-generating units as a thermal source for boilers instead of burning more fuel. Combined cycle power production increased from 8% in 2010 to 31% in 2019, while the use of the simple cycle decreased from 50% in 2010 to 22% in 2019. The total amount of clean energy produced from the combined cycle equals 59,258 MWh. By setting initial mitigation targets as illustrated in point 8 in the graph below, we are raising our commitments closer to meeting global climate change mitigation standards and enhancing our standing compared to peers. Hence, our approach to carbon footprint reduction has rested on the following action items:Mitigating Climate Change SEC\u2019s GHG emissions reduction achievments1.1.

        "content": "ESG Report -2019 ESG Report -201930 31 Our Environmental Policy, which is in place since 2009, promotes the reliance on clean energy sources, efficient resource consumption, reusing and recycling, waste reduction as well as compliance with environmental laws and regulations. The main aim of the policy is to reduce our negative environmental impact, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, through proactive management and continuous monitoring our environmental performance. We also take a proactive approach in terms of engaging our stakeholders, such as employees, suppliers and contractors, to make sure everyone is aware of the Policy and abides to its obligations. Ultimately, we are committed to working in accordance with the prevailing environmental regulations, without compromising our responsibilities in meeting the Kingdom\u2019s energy needs.  In order to unify the efforts and actions related to the environment, an Environmental Compliance Committee is in place, which consists of at least one representative from each Activity at SEC. The Division of Environmental Protection & Development in the Dedicated environmental compliance workshops are held for department heads and managers in operating areas where findings from environmental audits need to be addressed to achieve compliance with environmental standards and regulations. In addition, environmental compliance courses are conducted for environmental representatives, to educate them about the principles of environmental protection as well as the application of our environmental compliance documents. These courses are conducted in cooperation with the Canadian Memorial University across three training tracks: 1. Awareness Trainings (one--week): given to environmental representatives and environmental compliance sub-committees representatives in operating areas. 2. Awareness Trainings (1.5 months): extensive on- site trainings held in cooperation with the Canadian As of 2019, 22 of our 40 sites have obtained ISO 14001, ISO 9001 and/or ISO 19600 certifications. Certifications for the remaining sites are being pursued, including ISO 45001 and EFQM. All of our projects are designed to comply with the environmental regulations and legislations that contribute to improving the environment in the Kingdom. 29 sites obtained environmental licenses and certificates from the General Authority of Meteorology and Environmental Protection (GAMEP), while licenses for the remaining sites are being pursued. To monitor compliance, quarterly reports are sent to the GAMEP . In addition, financing requirements of the World Bank are being achieved (represented by field visit). Our environmental compliance audits re based on an environmental audit protocol compliant with ISO 19011: 2011. Our ongoing commitments related to environmental compliance include:Memorial University to engage environmental representatives and specialists in generation activity. 3. Advanced Training Program: environmental specialists from our Generation Activity are sent to the Canadian Memorial University. 43 environmental specialists have been trained in this program so far. In cooperation with T\u00dcV NORD of Germany we also run a program to certify environmental auditors. As of 2019, 17 environmental auditors from the Environmental Sector of Industrial Security have been trained and accredited to conduct environmental audits at all the company\u2019s facilities. The program is conducted in accordance with the audit protocol and the standards of the International Register of Certified Auditors (IRCA) organization. \u2022 Conducting annual environmental audits on main work locations. \u2022 Identifying and follow-up correction of environmental non-conformities as identified by audit reports. \u2022 Conducting Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) for projects and existing installations and obtain environmental permits. \u2022 Periodic monitoring and reporting of environmental compliance to GAMEP . \u2022 Environmental awareness raising and training. \u2022 Allocating budgets to finance emission monitoring and control.Industrial Security Sector coordinates all committee meetings, which are held almost every three months. During these meetings the committee reviews performance on a company-wide level and reports the compliance level on a quarterly basis. In coordination with the members of the Environmental Compliance Committee, dedicated Environmental Protection Coordinators are identified for each site and directly associated with each site manager. These coordinators are tasked to follow up on achieving compliance with environmental standards in all the company\u2019s locations. As of 2019, a total number of 107 environmental coordinators were in place. In order to ensure that environmental compliance awareness is cascaded throughout the company, environmental compliance requirements are defined for sector heads and department managers on a regular basis. Compliance and Certifications January, 2019 Environmental Policy SEC and its subsidiary companies recognize the potential for their activities to impact upon the environment. We accept our responsibility to minimize our impact on the environment and to comply with all applicable envir onmental laws and regulations. We understand that we have an obligation to prevent pollution, and to protect the environment and public health. This must be done in a manner that supports sustainable development and does not compromise our obligation to pr ovide for our customer\u2019s power needs. In support of this, we will work to continually improve our environmental performance. To achieve this, we will: \uf0b7 Integrate environmental considerations into business and decision making processes. \uf0b7 Pursue more efficient use of resources within the business, including increased focus on the reuse & recycling of resources and on waste minimization measures. \uf0b7 Promote clean energy and adopt best practical technologies and the most suitable options to minimize

        "content": "ESG Report -2019 ESG Report -201932 33 In order to minimize our emissions, we made several investments in our own operations. Many of our sites use the latest technologies in accordance with international best practices in the field of environmental and sustainability, such as our ash extraction systems, nitrogen oxide (NOx) and sulfur oxide (SO) reduction systems, and continuous emission control systems. The installation of a Dry Low NOx combustion system significantly reduced our NOx emissions by more than 60%. In addition, the use a Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) system in some steam power plants and the installation of seawater Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) technology has reduced our air pollution from SO emissions by 90%, while the use of electrostatic precipitators in units operated by heavy fuel reduced the emission of suspended residues by 99%. We also stopped the use of certain chemicals that are harmful to the environment and health, such as Freon 12, Methane Trilateral Chloride, Halen and Asbestos, replacing them with harmless substances. To reduce and avoid any Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF6) emissions, we regularly perform inspection, leak detection, troubleshooting, maintenance and proper storage of gas cylinders.Fugitive emissions are managed and controlled in line with stringent criteria regarding the handling, storage and treatment of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). Overall the percentage of organic solvent lost through fugitive emissions shall not exceed 3% in degraded airsheds and 5% in all other areas. A Fugitive Emission Management Plan (FEMP) is required for all sites that use either 200 tons of solvents per year or that operate at a rate of 150 kg of solvents per hour at any time. Where solvents or other VOCs are handled, employees are trained in the handling, use, good housekeeping and waste management of such materials. Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) are managed accordingly too, to avoid any toxic emissions. This includes regularly scheduled inspections, leak testing and servicing and maintenance of equipment containing refrigerants or halon fire suppression systems, procedures to react to any leakage of ODS as well as end-of-life procedures. Overall, we track, record and monitor the concentration of emissions from all generating plants to keep them within the permitted limits. Thanks to our portfolio diversification efforts to foster mitigation co-benefits over the past four years, our direct GHG emissions dropped by 14%. Our indirect emissions increased by 20%, however, our total GHG emissions slightly declined by 5% since 2016. Our GHG emission intensity is following a positive downward trend, a reduction of 7% over the past four years. NOx emissions decreased more significantly, by 26%, and SF6 emissions by even 50%, whereas SOx emissions remained relatively stable since 2016. 1.1.1.          Promoting Renewable Energy SEC has been pioneering renewable energy, to support the Kingdom\u2019s efforts to reduce its reliance on oil for power generation. In 2011 we implemented the first solar photovoltaics (SPV) project in Farsan in the south of the country, together with Showa Shell. The project was the first grid-connected solar PV project in Saudi Arabia.In 2017 we marked a further milestone by commissioning the development of a 2.75 MW wind turbine at Huriamla, approximately 70 km from Riyadh. This project was developed in partnership with General Electric. To foster investment by the private sector in renewable energy and thereby kickstart the Kingdom\u2019s renewable energy strategy, SEC commits to offtake the increased production of installed renewable energy capacities. Saudi Power Purchase Company (SPPC), which was established as a wholly owned subsidiary by SEC in 2017, has signed the first 25-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with ACWA Power. The Sakaka project is one of the first large scale solar energy projects in Saudi Arabia, with a capacity of 300 MW. The plant will harness solar energy 1.1.2. by utilizing cutting-edge photovoltaic (PV) technology to generate electricity at a world record-breaking tariff of US Cents 2.3417/kWh (8.781 halalas/kWh). 2019 marked an important milestone for the project, as first production started in mid-December 2019, while the project is expected to be fully operational by 2020.Besides the Sakaka project, we signed another 20-year power purchase agreement in 2019. The Doumat Al- Jandel wind farm project has a capacity of 400 MW and is expected to start commercial operation in 2022 .We also signed two Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts to develop two power plants producing electric power integrated with solar thermal energy. The power plant at Duba Al-Khadra is intended to produce a total of 605 MW of energy, including 50 MW of solar energy, and the power plant at Waad Al-Shamal industrial city will produce a total of 1,390 MW plus 43 MW of solar energy.

We already successfully integrated the first ever utility-scale renewable energy utility, Sakaka SPV plant, into the grid in 2019, and are expecting to complete the connection to the following projects in 2020-2021: Overall, we plan to invest more than SAR 797 million to connect the above mentioned renewable energy projects to the grid. Furthermore, we expect to invest app. SAR 8.2 billion in renewable integration projects during the period 2022-2025, to grow the renewable capacity connected to the grid to 27.6 GW.In line with the KSA vision 2030 and the Kingdom\u2019s (INDCs), energy efficiency is another key pillar of the Kingdom\u2019s economic diversification with mitigation co-benefits approach, yielding energy and financial savings. SEC demonstrated good progress in terms of improving the supply side efficiency, as evidenced by an upward trend in the generation thermal efficiency over the last 5 years. The overall generation fleet thermal efficiency has increased to 40% as per 2019, compared with 39% in 2018 and 31% in 2010. Our aim is to reach an overall generation fleet thermal efficiency of 45% by 2030.To reduce the consumption of natural resources, we implemented several measures to improve energy efficiency. Our fuel consumption has decreased from 2.01 barrels of oil /MWh in 2010 to 1.7 barrels of oil /MWh in 2019. We plan to reduce our fuel consumption further to reach 1.4 barrels/MWh by 2024. One of the key measures that contributed to reducing fuel consumption was the replacement of 65 low-efficiency generation units with new high-efficiency generation units during the period 2016-2018.Our direct energy use in 2019 amounted to 327.7 million barrels of oil equivalent (mboe), a 11% reduction compared to 2016.

We use technical programs and modern technical solutions to control the operation of the service in our buildings, which work automatically to shut down electric power during specific times according to its programming and when not needed. In addition, we are keen to use electrical devices and equipment with environmentally friendly specifications to keep up with modern technologies in energy saving. Overall, we were able to reduce the electricity consumption from our own buildings by 14% over the past four years. This is mainly attributable to efficiency gains, but also the investment in roof top solar panels to feed zero emission energy into our own buildings. Our new SEC headquarter in Riyadh, completed in early 2019, was designed to comply with the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building standards. The building was designed in a way to be energy efficient, e.g. by reducing the reception of sunlight, taking advantage of natural lighting to save energy, using thermal insulation materials, reducing glass facades and using heat-insulating glass, energy- saving lamps and thermostats that control heat, humidity and air time for air conditioning units. In addition, the building is partially operated by renewable energy and wastewater from the bathrooms is treated and reused for irrigation. As a result, the energy production and consumption from renewable sources increased remarkably over the years, more than 30-fold since 2016 to a total of 6,709 MWh in 2019. A similar trend is seen in our electricity self-consumption, which dropped by 14% over the past four years.charge for our employees. Overall, electric vehicles offer a great opportunity for SEC to improve the efficiency of the electricity system in the Kingdom. Depending on the way the charging of such vehicles is managed, it would be possible to reduce the differences between periods of high consumption and low consumption, thus facilitating the integration of non-manageable energy sources such as wind power and improving the system utilization. Hence, our strategic direction envisions positioning SEC as key enabler for electric mobility within the Kingdom in the future.

        "content": "ESG Report -2019 ESG Report -201938 39 In late 2019 we started implementing a Smart Meter Project (SPM) that can be seen as key enabler of digitalisation in the Kingdom. Under this project, valued more than SAR 9.7 billion, we aim to install around 10 million smart meters. The large-scale roll-out of smart meters is part of our effort to increase the reliability and efficiency of our distribution networks and will enable us to achieve the highest accuracy in monitoring consumption, improve service quality, enhance customer satisfaction and optimize the use of natural and financial resources.Environmental benefits of the project come in the form of annual GHG emissions and energy savings due to improved energy efficiency in the grid. Based on industry benchmarks of similar projects, the SMP could potentially reduce the energy consumption by 1% per smart meter. Furthermore, additional environmental benefits are expected due to expected reduction of required field operations and its related transportation trips. Hence, more than 100 million electro-mechanical meter reading trips as well as more than 1 million trips related to disconnect and reconnect per annum could potentially be avoided. The project also has localization component. Through sourcing app. 3.5 million smart meters from local manufacturers, we directly support local capacity building and the creation of new manufacturing The Saudi Energy Efficiency Center (SEEC) is responsible for coordinating the efforts of government and non- government agencies in this regard. Active for over six years now, SEEC has developed a national program to conserve and raise energy efficiency. The program, entitled the Saudi Energy Efficiency Program, is designed to increase efficiency in three main sectors that together account for over 90% of national energy consumption: buildings, industry and land transportation. Buildings use about 75% of total electricity produced in the Kingdom, whereby air-conditioning units account for about 65% of this consumption. Since thermal insulation can help reduce energy consumption of air-conditioning units by as much as 30%, a high priority has been given to improvivng the energy efficiency of air conditioners and enforcing thermal insulation of buildings. Pursuant to Royal Decree No. 6927/MB, the application of thermal insulation in all new residential or commercial buildings or any facilities in major cities of the Kingdom is mandatory. In 2013, the company began to train a dedicated team of more than 180 engineers and inspectors which are qualified to ensure the commitment to thermal insulation in buildings is met. Since 2013 thermal insulation has been applied to more than 245,042 buildings in the kingdom to contribute to reducing energy consumption.industries in the Kingdom. Overall, the smart meters are expected to considerably contribute to optimal usage of energy in the Kingdom, as well as improving networks in terms of demand-size management and overall access to electricity. The roll out started in January 2020, with target milestones of 35% implementation by 30 April 2020, 50% implementation by 30 September 2020, 80% implementation by 31 December 2020 and 100% implementation by 31 March 2021. The smart metering project is also in line with our strategic direction to support the customer journey through digitalization and innovation. Smart meters are connected through a telecommunications system to ultimately build an Advanced Metering Infrastructure system consists of  the Smart Meters, Meter Data Management System (MDMS), Smart Meter Operation center (SMOC). This provides electricity usage data and will support a range of digitalized services and solutions to customers, empowering them to more efficiently manage their consumption. In addition, it gives us greater end-to-end visibility of the conditions in the power system and enhances overall reliability and safety.Our work with regards to demand side energy efficiency involves planning and implementing measures aimed at influencing the way in which electrical energy is consumed. Our efforts to trigger changes in the demand curve focus on the reduction of overall energy consumption, the reduction in consumption during peak hours (periods of maximum consumption) as well as shifting consumption to periods of minimum consumption (off-peak hours). Shifting some electrical loads in order to reduce the load peak during the day has also improved resource efficiency. This was achieved by shifting some loads from peak hours to off-peak hours, e.g. by using refrigeration storage and controlling air conditioning loads of our top subscribers.

Therefore, the company is also mindful of the importance of research, development and innovation to improve the efficiency of the performance of the electrical system and increase its reliability. In 2019 the main highlights and achievements include the enhanced generation capabilities of 4 generating units with a total of 824 MW as well as strengthening the capacity of the transmission network by adding new transmission stations and connecting them with overhead lines and underground cables. as of 2019 end, a total of 412 projects with a contractual value exceeding SAR 62 billion are under implementation to enhance the power generation and transmission capacity of the network.Network automation to improve grid efficiency and reliability In line with the KSA Vision 2030, we are pursuing the automation and digitization of our distribution network and customer service to reduce network losses and promote more efficient and economic dispatch decisions. We therefore seek to fully digitalized the national control center and our eight control centers in the main cities, as well as automating approximately 100 thousand electric switches by 2025. This effort will not only improve the reliability and efficiency of the electricity network but is also expected to contribute to reduce network losses and facilitate network maintenance.",

We mainly use sea water in our processes, as well as freshwater. In line with our Environmental Policy and national regulations, we aim to reduce consumption and minimize water pollution from our operations.Most of the sea water is used directly without treatment, like the water that is used to cool turbines or as fire water. Cooling water is discharged back to sea, without any treatment, except the use of chlorine to prevent the growth of algae and microorganisms and regulating the temperature to match sea water. We regularly take samples and study the discharge to sea to make sure we comply with the environmental regulations from the GAMEP . At other instances, sea water is desalinated. This water is used in operational activities and different utilities in the stations as well as for boilers to form steam. This wastewater is stored in tanks and is PH regulated before discharged with cooling or rainwater to make sure it complies with the environmental regulations from the GAMEP . We also use water in cleaning units and boilers. In such cases, chemicals are added, such soda and sodium sulfide. This water is collected and stored and evaporation pools and is never discharged back to the sea.Water that is contaminated with oils and fuel is contained in tanks and treated by removing oils in an oil separator unit. The remaining oil is reused as fuel, and the wastewater is sent back to the oil separator pool. Sewage water is never discharged but stored in tanks and treated internally in the sewage water treatment station in the power plant or transported to a centralized treatment station outside the power plant.Sanitary water, after being biologically treated, is used for irrigation purposes to increase the green coverage within the area of power plants and partially offset GHG emissions on nearby residential districts, while reducing the use of potable water for irrigation purposes. We regularly conduct marine surveys of coastal areas to assess our impact on water quality and marine sediments, as well as the biological diversity in the marine environment.As part of our efforts to reduce water consumption in production and promote water reuse and recycling, our generation power plants currently treat sewage and waste water internally and recycle it to irrigate green areas within our facilities. Furthermore, our PP10 and PP12 generation power plants in Riyadh also started using treated sewage water imported from outside the stations instead of using non-renewable groundwater. This practice has contributed to growing usage of combined cycle units in energy production in all regions of the Kingdom, which was limited before in coastal stations only.To reduce water consumption in our buildings, the company\u2019s audit team periodically checks all locations \u2013 3,896 buildings across 493 locations in the Kingdom - to ensure that water consumption is managed in terms of measuring consumption, but also to oversee water rationalization methods, such as reusing or recycling water. Thanks to such rationalization efforts, municipal freshwater consumption has decreased by 22% since 2016.Overall, our total water consumption increased by 68% over the last four years. However, we do recycle and reuse a vast amount of our water consumed, 95.15% in 2019. 1.2.1.

Our waste management strategy starts with the procurement process. Prior to buying products, we seek to ensure they will not create a potential environmental problem, and we seek to purchase the most environmental\u2010friendly and energy efficient product whenever practical. In addition, we seek to manage our waste through: Source Reduction: We seek to avoid generation of waste, including reduction of excess packaging and returning it back to suppliers. Re-use and Recycling: To keep resources in the life cycle as long as possible, any output of our processes should be used as input for another process, to avoid waste creation.Treatment: Testing and processing of waste is required prior to disposal to reduce potentially harmful environmental impacts. Monitoring: We keep track of the waste generated and regularly monitor and develop plans and programs to eliminate and reduce waste.In line with our Environmental Policy we continuously aim to reduce any sort of soil contamination throughout our operations, in compliance with the local environmental regulations. To achieve this, we implement a number of initiatives, includes the following: Developing and applying programs to reduce spills, and leakages. Removing all power transformers that use oils containing carcinogenic substances such as polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), one of the most toxic substances, to ensure that no contamination is caused to the soil, surface water, and groundwater in order to secure the safety of humans, animals, and plants. Using sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), a potent isolation gas, in the electrical switches instead of oils, which contributes to reducing the possibility of leakage, seepage, and subsequently water and soil pollution.Using dry cured cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cables instead of oily cables to reduce probability of leakage and contamination of water and soil. Replacing all the currently used insecticides with less harmful ones. Relying on qualified contractors to remove any petroleum and oil residues in generating plants in ways that will not cause harm to the environment. Constantly cooperating with local and international universities and research centers to create suitable solutions to the problem of carbonic ashes.

Other hazardous wastes such as waste oil and chemicals are collected and sold to specialized waste contractors. SEC has begun a strategic transformation program to identify ways to convert the carbon ash from a hazardous substance into a material that can become a source of income for the company. Carbon ash is harmful to the environment, hence, safely disposing it in a landfill is expensive. In cooperation with research centers, such as the Memorial University Canada, we are investigating the possibility of extracting valuable metals from carbon ash, such as vanadium, nickel or active carbon, or to use it in water purification and the treatment of gas emissions from boilers.We also signed an agreement with Al-Safwa Cement company to re-use carbon ash as alternative fuel in their production, in accordance with the requirements of the General Authority for Meteorology and Environmental Protection. So far, this has contributed to reducing the negative effects on the environment by avoiding air and soil pollution, as well as saving more than SAR 47 million per year for disposal costs. In addition, the cement factory reported a 20% energy saving. Under this agreement, a total of 200,000 cubic meters of carbon ash will be transported from Shuaiba stations, Rabigh, South Jeddah, and Shuqaiq. This project won the \u201cGreat Idea of the Year\u201d award at the 13th International Conference 2018 in Dubai and was also nominated for the Global Ideas award. Due to this success, we aim to extend the scope of this project, seeking further collaboration with other cement companies, to leverage the mutual benefits and ultimately have a positive impact on the environment. We safely dispose of all municipal waste generated by our operations through specialized and qualified contractors. This mainly includes: All damaged items that are viable for repair are repaired, either by our own repair workshops or with contracted companies, and then returned to stock again for reuse in the network. This usually includes materials such as standard-capacity distribution transformers, mono-stations, ring units or wing parts for the generator panels. All materials that are non-repairable, such as power plants, distribution stations, transformers, iron and wooden poles, copper and aluminium cables, scrap iron pieces etc., are sold at a salvage value for re-use through public auctions to competent entities, intermediaries or owners of scrap companies. Batteries are currently sold in public auctions to competent entities where they are disposed of according to the requirements of the General Authority for Meteorology and Environmental Protection. We currently work on the establishment of a direct sales contract for the disposal of batteries with one of the entities listed as environmentally qualified by the General Authority for Meteorology and Environmental Protection. Oils, including petroleum waste, empty barrels as well as oil residues and oil-water-mixtures, are currently sold for re-use and treatment by special contracts with qualified contractors in accordance with the General Authority for Meteorology and Environmental Protection. In terms of waste handling and storage, all waste generated at our premises has to be segregated, collected and stored properly prior to disposal. Only authorized and designated persons are allowed to handle the waste using appropriate personal protective equipment. Waste is collected in suitable containers which need to be properly secured, labelled and stored in designated areas until final disposal. We currently operate 16 designated waste management areas, in accordance with environmental standards. We also constructed steaming ponds, hazardous materials reservoirs and wastewater collection systems at various sites as we plan to improve our oil and water separation systems. In order to prevent leaks of wastes and their components into the environment, an environmental monitoring plan including groundwater and air quality monitoring is in place for dedicated waste storages sites. Over the past years, our total waste generation decreased drastically, by 64% since 2017, esp. our non-hazardous waste generation. At the same, we improved our recycling efforts. In 2019 we recycled 12.33% of our total waste, up from only 3.56% in 2017.

Our Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) standard mandates conducting an EIA before a project can begin, in the feasibility/design stage. EIAs are conducted in line with the General Authority of Meteorology and Environmental Protection (GAMEP) standards and requirements by GAMEP certified third party environmental consultants. Each EIA study assesses air quality, soil, geology and groundwater, marine, water and sediment quality, noise and vibration, solid waste and wastewater management, terrestrial ecology, landscape and amenity as well as the overall socioeconomic status of a project. Within EIA, a biodiversity impact assessment guideline provides guidance on managing biodiversity risks as appropriate. The assessment also includes a series of Health, Safety, Security and Environmental (HSSE) standards and guidelines. In addition to EIA, Best Available Technology (BAT) studies are also considered when designing new projects, whereby technology used should meet GAMEP standards and guidelines. In total, 35 EIA studies and environmental reviews were conducted for new projects and existing generation and transmission facilities. To further understand our impact on local ecosystems, we conduct marine surveys of coastal areas to assess the environmental influences of the electric power generation plants on water quality and marine sediments, as well as the biological diversity in the marine environment. In cooperation with GenosTech we conducted a pilot project at the Rabigh power plant with the aim to understand the impact on aquaculture and microalgae. In addition, marine surveys were conducted for all coastal stations in Rabigh, Shuaiba, Ghazalan and TheVillage, and an aquaculture project for coral reefs was conducted at our Jeddah Power Plant. In addition, we contribute to spreading and promoting environmental awareness among all employees, customers, contractors and suppliers. We are providing specialized courses and awareness programs in various environmental fields, for various activities and sectors of the company, and enable employees to complete qualifying courses and obtain international certificates in the field of environmental protection, in cooperation with international partners. SEC acknowledges the importance of raising awareness among the community and supporting environmental programs and activities by sponsoring important events and environmental conferences. Since 2017, we organize a Clean Environment Forum annually at one of the Kingdom\u2019s main cities. The program usually includes presentations of key working papers and the hosting of a number of specialists and prominent environmental workers to share their experience. In 2020, SEC is plans to host the fourth version of the forum in Riyadh city. In addition, we sponsored the Gulf Environment Forum, contributed to working papers and newspaper articles and raised public awareness via lectures in schools and campaigns around Earth Hour, Earth Day or Cleaner Environment. We continue to emphasize the importance of preserving the environment and rationalizing electricity consumption by printing indicative phrases on electronic electricity bills and publishing electronic flyers and leaflets on our website1.2.3. Biodiversity, Environmental Protection and Awareness Raising In 2016, we completed the construction of a fuel-fired thermal power plant 30 km south of Jeddah. The station consists of a 2.7 km long, dredged channel for sea water inlet. As part of the project\u2019s environmental best practices, artificial coral reefs are to be established in the nearby waters to increase habitats for fish and coral to thrive. We have chosen three sites for building artificial reefs, covering an area of 2.4 km2. Highlight story: Artificial reef at South Jeddah Power Plant.[103-1], [103-2], [103-3]",

Under these amendments the following key changes were decided and implemented in 2019: The Supply Chain & Contracting and General Services were merged into one activity - Services & Contracts. This activity now encompasses five key sectors : Contracts, Materials, Industrial Security, Transport and Facilities. The Information Technology sector was spun off from General Services into its own business line and is now referred to as Information Technology & Digital Transformation, falling under the direct supervision of the CEO. The Planning & Performance Monitoring business line was renamed to Strategic Planning & Business Development. This activity now encompasses three key sectors: Corporate & Strategic Planning, Regulatory Affairs & Performance Monitoring and New Business Development. The Cybersecurity Department was structurally spun off from General Services and now falls under the direct supervision of the CEO. To support the company\u2019s plans to develop a highly qualified and multi-skilled employee base, we are seeking to make our training more efficient and targeted to the needs of our employees and the business alike. Under our HR business plan, we made an effort to integrate the learning approach with career paths, in order to establish a more customized and competency-based learning approach across all employee levels, with an updated curriculum based on career grades and learning needs. SEC has an online interactive training portal that uses the latest technologies to provide an ideal environment for self-training for any user at any time and in any place, where this program allows hundreds of courses for thousands of employees every year. SEC is further looking into developing and launching Learning Management System to: 1. Support business lines and Employee targeted development. 2. Work with key stakeholders to understand their development needs (Human Resource Development, Executive and Leadership Development Center, Career Path, Succession Planning, Business Lines). 3. Source a world class Learning Management System which can meet the needs of our new approach to learning and development. Overall, the total number of training hours delivered in 2019 was 977,559 hours, almost equal to the training hours provided in 2018, but a 26% decrease compared to 2016. The average training hours provided to employees stood at 28.8, a slight increase compared to the previous year, but a 16% decrease compared to 2016. Executive and Leadership TrainingIn line with our approach to executive development, management level employees received an average of 45.4 hours of training in 2019. We have partnered with several international organizations to support our leadership development over the past few years. 10 of our leaders have attended a Master programs at MIT, and we are partnering with the International Institute for Management Development (IMD) to develop 105 of our leaders until 2022. We also run a number of internal leadership programs for top-mid-level and front-line leaders in 2019, including our Targeted Talent Program (TTP) and our Leading with Impact (LWI) series, which focused on courses such as executive presentations and presence, the four disciplines of execution, crucial conversations, crucial accountability, financial acumen, mastering emotional intelligence, engagement session and accountability in action. We also initiated a new partnership with ERTYAD, a local academic institution, in 2019, to conduct workshops on high impact presentations, professional presence and presentations, and executive presence and presentations. We also offer an intensive English language program for our leader, to develop their English language skills and enable them to carry out their current or planned duties effectively.Workforce Training and Development Focus Areas  Strategic Goals  Initiatives Business Impact  Organization and Talent Focus on talent and organizational performance to enhance sustainable business success.

The curriculum of the program was designed and implemented by RBL Group, and in 2019 a total of 1,802 employees participated in the programs, of which 81 employees successfully graduated. General Training and Development ProgramsIn 2019, our non-management employees spent more than 900,000 hours of training in internal and external courses, an average of 27.9 hours per employee. This included a total of 44,429 short-term development courses, as well as various self-learning and e-learning training programs. We have four training institutes across the country, which were converted into investment entities. We obtained training licenses from the General Foundation for Technical and Vocational Training and developed trainings and specialized workshops as well as professional accreditation courses which were delivered to more than 6,243 participants outside SEC. In order to ensure our programs are effective in terms of improving our employee\u2019s efficiency, productivity and knowledge, they all complement each other. The most important programs are our on-the-job training program, short development courses tailored to employees in all technical, administrative and professional specialties as well as our cooperative trainer program aimed at improving the experience of employees in technical and administrative areas. In collaboration with Toastmasters, an international non-profit educational organization, we provide our employees with the opportunity to improve and build on their communication and leadership skills. In addition, our \u201cI\u2019m learning\u201d program is an interactive online training program with hundreds of courses, providing an ideal environment for self-training for all our employees at any time and from anywhere. Development of NationalsWe also place great importance on the development of our national employees and hence offer various targeted programs for their development, including our career program which offers technicians graduating from University work and training opportunities within the company, our supported training program which provides training and development based on the nature of their current or targeted business function. We also run a two-year development program for Saudi university graduates, which aims to develop their professional and administrative skills and competencies, as well as a qualification and training program for graduates of technical (industrial) colleges, secondary school and industrial high school. In addition, our Saudi Expertise Development Program is aimed at providing Nationals with the skills needed to perform specialized functions in specific areas, such as managing the electrical system with high efficiency, keeping pace with technological developments in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, the economic and commercial operation of the electrical system as well as research and scientific development of the company. In order to increase productivity, performance and ultimately retention we seek to create a culture that continuously measures and responds to employee concerns. Therefore, our HR team undertakes periodic surveys that are shared with employees to better understand their requirements, aspirations, and learn their views on job functions, responsibilities, work environment and work experience. The results of these surveys are communicated with the management team, who tries to meet employee needs and satisfaction. Thereby, our performance reviews also inform development needs, based on personal preferences but also the company\u2019s needs. Under our HR business plan, we aim to launch a cultural change project for performance management, to improve perceptions of performance appraisal fairness. Thereby, we seek to create a motivating and high-performance work environment based on objective performance management of employees, as well as ensuring a uniform application of performance management policy to all staff at all levels to achieve the principle of justice and raise the level of satisfaction of employees and their confidence in performance to redress their efforts. Our Employee Excellence Program, which seeks to motivate employees to excel in performance, rewards outstanding performance on a monthly (Employee of the Month) or annual (Public Servant) basis, creating an environment of positive competition between the employees of the company.

Our compensation package includes base salary, allowances, benefits as well as bonus plans. We also provide health services to employees and their families through our insurance partner Medgulf Insurance, as well as onsite health service employees, such as doctors and specialists, which can be attended in case of medical needs. Our savings program for our Saudi employees seeks to motivate them and enhance their loyalty and affiliation to the company, while helping them accumulate savings and benefits upon retirement or separation from the company. Under the program, we deduct a part of the salary as a voluntary investment for the benefit of the employee, choosing appropriate areas of investment in accordance with Islamic investment conditions. By the end of 2019, a total of 14,255 employees benefited from this program.One of our very successful programs is our housing loan, which is in place for the eleventh year already. Under this program we provide housing loans to our Saudi employees to finance the acquisition, construction or completion of the construction of housing, in a sharia-compliant form (Murabaha). We provide financing of up to SAR 1,200,000 with a repayment period of 20 years, whereby the company\u2019s contribution extends up to 70% of the profit margin, employees need to bear the remaining percentage. During 2019, a total of 377 employees benefited from the program, which already supported a total of 5,324 employees since its inception. We also offer our employees the opportunity to take parental leave. In 2019 six of our female employees took parental leave, whereby the return to work rate to date is at 100%. SEC has made a formal commitment to address health and safety in its Social Responsibility Policy and its Safety, Occupational Health and Environmental Protection Policy, in line with local legislation and regulations. We are committed to maintain a safe, hygienic and healthy work environment and to minimize occupational hazards and ensure work can be completed effectively. Therefore, we deployed significant measures to address health and safety for our employees and contractors.  Our 5-star occupational health and safety management system is a risk-based, management-led and audit-driven system, whereby we aim to achieve compliance with ISO 450001 in 2020. The system defines performance and monitoring requirements across five key pillars: (1) cleanliness and tidiness in the workplace, (2) protective barriers for mechanical and electrical equipment, and people, (3) prevention of, and protection from fires, (4) recording incidents and inspecting them and (5) safety system.2.1.2 It is the duty of management and employees alike, at all levels, to promote and maintain safety and health regulations in the work practices. This also extends to our contractors and supplies, who need to demonstrate they are working in line with our health and safety policies and regulations, which is ensured by monitoring and HSE audits. Whoever violates these policies and procedures will face disciplinary measures according to our internal policies. In 2019, a total of 48 breaches in contractor compliance with SEC Health and Safety requirements were registered, leading to work suspensions.

In light of this development, SEC has adopted a number of future projects and plans to meet the growing demand on electrical power. This includes most notably the addition of new generation capacities of 3,834 MW in our plants, as well as the addition of generating capacities of 7,300 MW within the private sector participation program. By 2022, 7,560 km circular transmission lines will be added with 124,900 km length to strengthen the distribution networks. We also continued the rehabilitation and replacement of retiring distribution network equipment to maintain reliability of the network an avoid any voltage instability or outages. We extended our distribution network by app. 3% year on year, adding about 23,055 km of new medium and low voltage cables, increasing the network capacity by additional 8,650 MVA, which allowed us to connect more than 370,000 new customers. Since we are keen to provide our customers with advanced and intelligent systems, we have launched our \u2018Barq\u2019 service, which has reduced the lead time of electrical service delivery to 7 days only, after taking in excess of 20 days previously. Reducing the new connection period to 7 days contributed to the reduction of the total average time to connect new customers to 17 days average during 2019. We will continue to roll-out this service across the Kingdom, and to achieve our target of 7 days time to connect new customer in 2020. This reform was a remarkable achievement, which also contributes to facilitating the opening of new businesses in the Kingdom. Following the reform, the Kingdom\u2019s World Bank rating for the ease of obtaining an electricity connection improved by 42 positions to rank 18 and the Kingdom now ranks 62nd in terms of ease of doing business. Highlight Story: Dawiyat Telecom Company Dawiyat is a wholly owned telecom subsidiary of SEC, established with the aim of optimising investment in SEC\u2019s fiber optic systems to lease fiber optic networks to telecommunications companies. Dawiyat services are rendered over a state-of-the-art fiber optic network with more than 80,000 km of fiber optic cables across the Kingdom including villages, hamlets and borders.Offering open access fiber optic infrastructure to all operators on an equal basis assists in the provision of integrated telecommunications services and improves the quality and speed of internet access in the Kingdom. This is in line with Vision 2030 and the National Transformation Program 2020, which includes many initiatives in this respect, the most prominent of which is the initiative of deploying broadband fiber-optic systems to homes in the Kingdom. Dawiyat plays a key role in the process of connecting a total of 744,500 households across Saudi Arabia to its fiber optic network. A total of 488,000 households were connected by the end of 2019 and approximately 250,000 additional households are expected to be connected by the end of 2020. This is intended to drive growth in the Saudi economy and increase its competitiveness across different sectors. Dawiyat has entered into a number of partnerships at the local and regional levels to support its development objectives. Dawiyat has also agreed heads of terms with King Salman Energy Park \u201cSPARK\u201d to operate, maintain and commercialize its digital infrastructure and to provide smart services to contribute to the acceleration of the deployment of the fourth industrial revolution environment of the city. In addition, Dawiyat has been awarded the exclusive right by the Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones (MODON) to deploy fiber optic infrastructure for five industrial cities under MODON. This is intended to provide neutral access to all operators within the Kingdom in offering their services to their end customers. Dawiyat has also leased part of its fiber optic network to a number of telecommunications companies, to enable them to enhance their network footprint and services. Dawiyat is further constructing a carrier-neutral data center in partnership with Gulf Data Hub. The data center is located in King Abdullah University for Science & Technology and will serve the university and the tenants of the nearby research park in addition to serving customers across the Kingdom. As a result of the forecast growth in the international connectivity business in the region, Dawiyat is planning to extend the reach of its network beyond the geographical borders of the Kingdom and connect carriers in neighboring countries, as well as connecting other international carries via submarine cable systems.",

As a major service provider, customer satisfaction is absolutely essential to us. In line with our strategic direction to enhance our customer service as well as the Government\u2019s digital agenda, we are gradually moving towards more automation and digitization of services. We are working to define and execute a Digital Roadmap to support our strategy, enabling us to improve our efficiency as well as our customer experience, by fully digitizing our services and reforming the electricity connection process. The majority of customer services are already online and digitalized, as is our billing and invoicing process, which we can be accessed online or via our mobile application \u2018Alkahraba\u2019. These tools work well with customers, helping them get usage insights and track their historical consumption patterns and enable access to their bills accessible through their bank accounts. We also move all our customer service requests received through our call center to an electronic filing and tracking system.In an attempt to become a more customer centric organization, we launched a number of programs in 2019: Our \u2018Hisabi\u2019 service allows for a more direct interaction with our customers to be able to deliver services to them directly. The service enables clients to register the meter\u2019s account under the beneficiary\u2019s name as well as to transfer the account no matter if he or she is the tenant or the owner. This aims to help identify the actual beneficiary of the account, enable a more direct communication with the actual beneficiary of the account and determine which party is financially responsible for the electricity consumption. Our \u201cFixed bill\u201d service is another example of our advanced services. It helps subscribers adjusting their budgets based on the average value of their consumption over 12 months.Our \u2018Hasebati\u2019 service was launched in conjunction with updating our mobile services and enhancing our call centers. These initiatives support the digital transformation of the company\u2019s services as well as increasing the reliability of the electrical services and billing systems. To ensure business continuity of our distribution and customer services, we built a secure vault environment and cloud environment and also updated our disaster recovery environment and configuration of our systems to be able to restore infrastructure in the event our primary data center is unavailable We are also participating in the wider digitization effort of the Kingdom through the National Broadband Network of Saudi Arabia, one of the most important platforms to enable the KSA Vision 2030 objective of achieving ubiquitous fiber network deployment, high-speed broadband and connecting about 750,000 homes with an optic fiber to home connection. Our customers have access to our SEC-Hotline, an application which provides a safe way through which they can report any irregularities or abuses of the internal systems and regulations within SEC. SEC-Hotline also provides a safe outlet to report any excesses related to the work or services provided by the company, promoting the principle of transparency and anti-corruption. In 2019 we reached a 67% customer satisfaction rate, which we seek to increase to 70% in 2020. In addition, we aim to further reduce our time to connect from currently 17.9 days to 7 days next year. We also improved our service level, by reducing the number of days it takes to resolve complaints from 6 to less than 5 days.2.3.1.

As much as possible, we seek to purchase from and work with local suppliers and contractors to support the small and medium-sized enterprises across the Kingdom through our \u2018Bina\u2019 initiative. This approach covers three strategic initiatives: 1. Develop policies and procedures program to motivate local manufacturers and contractors: preference is given to suppliers that can demonstrate an increased local content, e.g. local content in materials, Saudization, training provided to Saudi nationals, local research and development etc. 2. Develop policies and procedures program to motivate small and medium enterprises: assign up to 10% of each purchase to SMEs as long as the price does not exceed 10% of the lowest bid, provide special support to new local factories that have less than three years of experience, support local vendors through direct purchases for up to 3 years. 3. Identify investment opportunities for localization: work with investors and international companies to attract them to the local industry market, enhance coordination and communication with government organizations and private corporations to develop local content and establish a strategic partnerships with investors to open companies and factories to produce services and materials which are not available locally.[102-9], [102-10], [103-1], [103-2], [103-3], [414-1], [414-2]",

Our spending on local suppliers amounted to SAR 2,481 million, or 62.0% of total of spending, a slight increase compared to 2018 too. Our material purchases between 2015 and 2019 amounted to app. SAR 29 billion, whereby 63% were procured from local factories.We have been implementing innovative solutions to streamline the procurement process since 2014. Our suppliers and contractors have access to our e-Bidding System, a fully automated web-based system using e-commerce concept. The system is a fully automated and paperless system and represents a cost-effective solution for vendors as they do not need to fax or personally submit their quotation. This significantly saves vendors time and money. The e-Bidding System enables fast and reliable communication as well as increase transparency since the quotations submitted by vendors are directly saved in a database. The system also ensures confidentiality of the data and prevents anyone from viewing the bid content before closing date. Furthermore, the e-Bidding System improves the system\u2019s security as the data is stored in SQL server and protected by a firewall and sensitive fields such as price and password are encrypted.To ensure we are able to provide the best products and services to our customers while acting in a responsible manner, all our suppliers and contractors are obliged to work in accordance with our norms of social responsibility and ethical behavior, as well as in compliance with local laws, legislation and regulations. Any contractor therefore has to sign their commitment to the SEC Code of Conduct and Ethics. Subject to the type of procurement, suppliers need to submit detailed information about their ESG performance in order to prequalify for our contracts. This includes, amongst others, data related to health and safety, employee engagement, waste management and spills as well as information related to management systems, procedures and training. All contractors need to abide by and adhere to SEC\u2019s health and safety standards in accordance with the 5-star Health & Safety management system which is followed inside SEC. All contractors invited to undertake environmental projects have to abide by SEC\u2019s environmental compliance standards and need to provide a valid Environmental Protection Qualification Certificate from the General Authority of Meteorology and Environment. All contractors invited to safety projects have to pre-qualify by obtaining a valid Contractor Classification Certificate from the General Authority for Industrial Security. In addition, all contracts include clauses related to environmental, health and safety, governance and labor regulations and standards compliance. Industrial Security conducts regular environmental compliance audits in accordance with ISO 19011, including projects under construction. Any contractor that is in breach of our standards and regulations are fined and blacklisted. Our Bina\u2019 Program to Build and Employ National Capacities Our Bina\u2019 program was launched in January 2019 to contribute to the KSA Vision 2030 and the active role of SEC in maximizing the local content participation and supporting local factories. The program has the following objectives: 1. Develop the capabilities of Saudi employees.2. Transfer technology to Saudi Arabia.3. Develop Saudi factories and contractors.4. Support national enterprises with greater resettlement efforts.5. Increase the proportion of local content.6. Support SMEs to contribute more to GDP . The achievements of the Bina\u2019 program include: Launching the Bina\u2019 localization strategy after being approved by the Board of Directors.Holding 12 workshops to introduce the Bina\u2019 program.Issuing the Investment Opportunities Handbook that contains more than 250 investment opportunities for the purpose of encouraging investors.

Our Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) reached SAR 24,041 million this year which is 11% higher than 2016. Also, we continue to receive an investment grade credit rating from global credit rating agencies. It has maintained high credit ratings, as rated by Standard & Poor\u2019s (A-), Fitch Group (A) and Moody\u2019s (A2). This indicates the soundness of the company\u2019s strategic 3.1.1. orientations, the success of its administrative and operational policies, and the effective management of its business. These ratings, reinforced have enabled the company to continue its efforts to implement its fiscal policies aimed at strengthening SEC\u2019s financial position, working on managing cash flows and providing what it takes to spend on its projects and funding commitments from various domestic and international sources of funding.

This report has been prepared in accordance with the GRI Standards: Core option (Appendix C) to ensure transparency of our economic, social and environmental (ESG) sustainability practices. The report covers our performance from 1st January until 31st December 2020, unless otherwise stated. Cautionary Statement This ESG Report contains certain forward-looking statements. All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could materially affect expected results of operations, cash flow and business prospects, because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that will or may occur in the future. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. For any inquires, feedback or suggestions regarding this report, please contact SEC\u2019s investor relations: Telephone: +966 11 80 79158 Email:  Shalhsaien@se.com.sa On behalf of Saudi Electricity Company (SEC), I would like to officially welcome you to our second ESG report. Despite the numerous challenges posed by the global COVID-19 pandemic, I am proud that our world-class operations, service, and financial sustainability have prevailed. SEC\u2019s leadership, in combination with all the excellent work conducted by SEC\u2019s employees and key stakeholders, have made it possible for SEC to remain the largest electric energy system provider in the MENA region. Moreover, the Kingdom\u2019s leadership continued its significant contribution towards SEC\u2019s success. Several transformative regulatory and financial reforms were passed over the last 12 months, in alignment with the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030, which aim to achieve the six pillars of the Kingdom\u2019s electric power sector strategy. I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere gratitude towards the Kingdom\u2019s leadership for its continued support and to everyone else involved with SEC, I look forward to continuing to lead SEC on our increasingly successful journey. As a world-class power provider, SEC understands its role regarding carbon emissions, climate change, and its responsibility towards the environment. We continued to both initiate and implement climate-related projects to help mitigate against climate change. In September 2020, SEC successfully issued a US$ 1.3bn RegS dual-tranche international Green Sukuk, becoming the first utility company in the Middle East to do so, and we plan to use these financial resources to expand our climate ambitions by financing and refinancing eligible green projects. Aligning our activities with the Saudi Vision 2030 and contributing to the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is a priority. Some noteworthy areas regarding our environmental contributions included facilitating the increase of renewable energy from Independent Power Producers to 916.6 gWh, a 1,374% increase from 2019, and completing most of the procurement and installation phases of the Smart Meter Program, which saw over 10 million smart meters installed that enhance energy efficiency. Investing in our employees and the communities within the Kingdom will always be important to SEC. Despite the difficulties posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, we managed to oversee 467,466 CEO Message Khalid H. Al-Gnoon Chief Executive Officer training hours for our employees and our workforce nationalization rate exceeded 93%. The percentage of the Kingdom\u2019s population with access to energy, which is enabled through SEC\u2019s work in collaboration with our many stakeholders, also remained at over 99%. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, health and safety was also prioritised this past year. We have been adopting COVID-19 guidelines and issuing guides with the latest government advice. The Company continues to use its channels and platforms to educate employees, citizens, and residents about the risks of COVID-19, which includes emails, internal screens, our website, the Bawabati application, and social media. As SEC continues to develop and enhance its sustainability strategy, I invite you to engage with us and to discover more about this journey through the analysis and discussion in this report. It is with pleasure that I present SEC\u2019s 2020 ESG Report as a testament to all the excellent work conducted by SEC\u2019s employees. [102-46]",

        "content": "2020 ESG REPORT 2020 ESG REPORT6 7 Saudi Electricity Company At a Glance The Government established the Ministry of Industry and Electricity in 1975, to organize and regulate the electricity sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (\u201cKingdom\u201d). In 2003, it became the Ministry of Water and Electricity and then, in respect of the electricity sector, the Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources. Following this transformation, the Kingdom was segregated into five operating regions, namely the Western, Easter, Central, Southern and Northern Regions.  Private and semi-private electricity companies that had previously provided electricity in each region were consolidated into four majority state-owned utilities known collectively as the Saudi Consolidated Electricity History Companies (SCECOs). Within the Northern Region, the General Electricity Corporation (GEC) was given responsibility for supervising the electricity companies operating within that region. A subsequent reform of the electricity sector resulted in the formation of one Saudi Electricity Company (SEC). SEC was incorporated as a joint stock company, with its headquarters in Riyadh. Following the formation of SEC, GEC and the four SCECOs were merged into SEC including all operations, rights, and liabilities. SEC reduced the operating structure from five to four regions, divided into sub-regional departments. These are the Western Region (with departments covering Makkah, Jeddah Madinah, Tabuk and Taif), the Eastern Region (with departments covering Dammam and Al Ahsa, the Northern province, the Al-Jouf province and the northern border), the Central Region (with departments covering Riyadh city and the Riyadh, Qassim, Alkharj, Dawadme and Hail provinces) and the Southern Region (with departments covering the Asir, Jizan, Najran and Baha provinces). Electricity Produced Energy Sold Number of Customers181,783 Gigawatt hours (gWh) 280,811 gWh 10.12 millionSEC\u2019s principal business activities include the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. SEC is the leading generator and provider of electricity, with a regulated monopoly position for the transmission of electric power and the distribution of electricity.Overview of Operations SEC\u2019s distribution business is responsible for the medium and low voltage power lines that connect high voltage transmission sub-stations to local sub-stations and the low voltage lines that provide electricity from local sub-stations to end-users. The distribution business is also responsible for metering, billing, collection of payments and electrical service connections in respect of electricity supplied to end-users.All the electricity produced by grid connected power plants in the kingdom is transmitted through SEC high-tension high voltage transmission grid. Electricity is carried through a network of transmission lines connected to substations set up in regions across the Kingdom. Electricity is then distributed to customers within those regions through SEC\u2019s distribution network.SEC is the leading producer of electricity, directly owning and operating 67% of total installed capacity in the Kingdom, and indirectly owns in another 15.9 Gigawatts (GW) through IPPs/IWPPs JVs. SEC utilizes a total installed capacity in the Kingdom of almost 79.7 GW.ENERGY GENERATION TRANSMISSION DISTRIBUTION AND CUSTOMER SERVICES",

These will be supplemented by improved distribution networks that will ultimately enhance supply reliability to consumers. The comprehensive reform package included the following: \u2022 Implementing the Minimum Service Operating Cost Model to regulate SEC\u2019s revenue and decide the required revenue for the fiscal year of 2020. \u2022 Cancellation of the government fees owed by SEC, enabling the Company to retain all revenues generated from applicable electricity consumption tariffs. \u2022 Setting up a revenue requirement mechanism for SEC, which includes a tariff-balancing account to compensate for the difference between the efficient cost to serve and the income from tariffs. \u2022 A mechanism to enable the timely settlement of public sector electricity bills. \u2022 The payment of all SEC\u2019s financial obligations from fuel and energy purchases, as well as government dues and distributing shareholder dividends owed. The comprehensive reform package also included the conversion of SAR 167.92 billion (US$44.72billion) net of government liabilities owed by SEC, as of 31 December 2019, into an equity-like non-dilutive financial instrument executed in a Mudaraba format. The Mudaraba agreement was signed with the Government represented by the Ministry of Finance. The recapitalized Government liabilities included Government loans and net Government payables and accruals; offsetting for outstanding amounts owed to SEC by the Government (i.e.: Government electricity receivables) according to SEC\u2019s financial statements at end of the fiscal year 2019. Additionally, it included SAR 3.4 billion, which is equivalent to the total dividends owed to Saudi Aramco since SEC\u2019s inception until 1439H or 2017G. This Mudaraba agreement transaction is considered the world\u2019s largest Islamic finance transaction to have ever be executed, demonstrating the Kingdom\u2019s leadership and global pre-eminence in Islamic finance.SEC expects the reforms and developments to play a key role in restructuring and strengthening its financial position, while simultaneously improving its ability to provide its services with higher levels of efficiency and reliability. The Minimum Service Operating Cost Model was implemented to regulate SEC\u2019s revenue and to decide its required revenue for the fiscal year of 2020, based on the balancing account coverage of the difference between the approved required revenues and the actual achieved revenue for SEC in 2020, which was decided at be an amount of SAR 6,131 million. The reforms also improve the ability of SEC to fulfil all its financial obligations including fuel payments, purchased power payments, and dividend payments to shareholders. Overall, the electricity sector\u2019s regulatory and financial reforms demonstrate the Government\u2019s continuous support to the electricity sector, how its endeavours to raise the overall level of services for its citizens and residents, and its commitment towards achieving the objectives of the Saudi Vision 2030.Sustainable Business Model Our ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) framework incorporates our sustainability ambitions, addresses the material issues affecting SEC\u2019s business activities and guides our ESG-related strategies and actions.

We proactively engage with all our stakeholders to ensure they understand and adhere to this policy, which includes encouraging the use of clean energy, responsible resource consumption, and reusing, In September 2020, SEC successfully issued a USD $1.3 billion Reg S dual-tranche international Green Sukuk, comprising two tranches of USD $650 million at 5 years and 10 years, respectively. The issuance was the first ever from the Kingdom, the first for a utility company in the Middle East region and was the largest corporate issuance in the Kingdom in 2020. The combined order book was oversubscribed 3.6 times and received significant orders from the MENA region and international accounts; 51% of orders for the 5-year tranche were from outside the MENA region and the 10-year tranche\u2019s orders were distributed between regional/Islamic and international accounts. Additional highlights from the issuance include an aggressive price tightening of 30 basis points (bps) from Initial Price Guidance (IPG), final pricing of 30bps inside Initial Price Talks (IPT) for both tranches, achieved -10 to -15 bps New Issuance Premiums (NIP) across both tranches, and the combined order books closed at USD $4.7 billion having peaked at USD $5.4 billion. An amount equal to the Sukuk\u2019s net proceeds will be separately identified and applied by SEC to finance and/or refinance, in whole or in part, eligible green projects. As per the Sukuk\u2019s Prospectus, eligible green project categories include: (a) energy efficiency, which shall consist of projects for the procurement and installation of smart meters and (b) renewable energy, which shall consist of projects, by way of capital expenditure, for the construction and/or operation of the transmission and/or distribution infrastructure for connecting renewable energy sources to the grid.

These courses provide instruction regarding the principles of environmental protection and how our environmental compliance documents should be used. The courses, conducted in cooperation with the Canadian Memorial University, focus on three training tracks that include a one-week awareness training course, an extensive one-and- a-half-month course, and also an advanced training program which environmental specialists complete at the Canadian Memorial University (over 43 have received such training). Moreover, in cooperation with T\u00dcV NORD of Germany, we run a program to certify our environmental auditors. As of 2020, 18 environmental auditors from the Environmental Sector of Industrial Security have been trained and accredited to conduct environmental audits at SEC\u2019s facilities. The program is conducted in accordance with the audit protocol and the standards of the International Register of Certified Auditors (IRCA) organization. Several of our sites utilize the latest environmental technologies and practices consistent with international best practice, including our ash extraction systems, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and sulphur oxides (SOx) reduction systems, and continuous emission control systems. Our Dry low-NOx combustion system significantly reduces NOx emissions by more than 60%. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems in certain power plants, and the installation of seawater Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) technology has reduced our air pollution from SOx emissions by 90%. Electrostatic precipitators, in units burning heavy fuel reduce the emissions of particulates by 99%. Environmentally harmful chemicals, such as Freon-12, Methane Trilateral Chloride, Halon, and Asbestos, have been replaced. To minimise Sulphur Hexafluoride (SF6) emissions, we regularly perform inspections, Carbon and Toxic Emissions Reduction leak detection, troubleshooting, maintenance, and ensure gas cylinders have been properly stored. Fugitive emissions are managed in accordance with stringent criteria regarding the handling, storage, and treatment of Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC). Overall, the percentage of organic solvent lost through fugitive emissions shall not exceed 3% in degraded airsheds and 5% in all other areas. A Fugitive Emission Management Plan (FEMP) is required for all sites that use either 200 tons of solvents per year or that operate at a rate of 150 kg of solvents per hour at any time. Where solvents or other VOCs are handled, employees are appropriate trained to handle, use and dispose of such materials. Emissions of Ozone Depleting Substances (ODS) are managed by regularly scheduled inspections, leak testing, maintenance of equipment containing refrigerants or halon fire suppression systems, procedures to react to any leakage of ODS, and end-of-life procedures. We continually monitor our power plant emissions levels and ensure these levels are within the permitted limits. We are constantly improving accurate measurement and recording of emission.

Starting in 2011, we commissioned the first grid-connected and the first solar photovoltaics (SPV) project with Showa Shell in Farsan. In 2017, we commissioned a 2.75 MW Promoting Renewable Energy (megawatt) wind turbine with General Electric in Huriamla. We have entered into two Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts to develop two power plants producing electric power integrated with solar thermal energy. The power plant at Duba Al-Khadra is intended to produce a total of 605 MW of power, including 50 MW of solar capacity, and the plant at Waad Al-Shamal industrial city will produce a total of 1,390 MW plus 43 MW of solar capacity. SEC has committed to offtake agreements for the increased production of installed renewable energy capacities. Saudi Power Purchase Company (SPPC), which was established as a wholly owned subsidiary by SEC in 2017, signed the first 25-year PPA with ACWA Power. The Sakaka project is one of the first large scale solar energy projects in Saudi Arabia, with a capacity of 300 MW. The plant will harness solar energy using cutting- edge PV technology to generate electricity at a world record-Renewable Energy Offtake breaking tariff of US Cents 2.3417/ kilowatt hour (8.781 halalas/kWh). In 2019, another 20-year PPA was signed with the Doumat Al-Jandel wind farm project. This project has a capacity of 400 MW and commercial operations start in 2022. More recently, SPPC signed a 25-year PPA for Sudair Solar Project. The project has a capacity of 1,500 MW and is the first project under the Public Investment Fund\u2019s renewable energy program. Through such commitments, we aim to promote private sector investment throughout the Kingdom and contribute towards the Kingdom\u2019s renewable energy strategy. By 2022, the renewable energy projects throughout the Kingdom are expected to increase the total renewable energy capacity to 3,587 MW, enabling a total avoidance of 7,899,000 tons of CO2 emissions per year. Through significant capital expenditure, SEC continues to connect new renewable energy sources to the grid; the renewable energy projects we have connected or are expecting to connect include: Up until 2025, we are planning to invest approximately SAR 7.1 billion into renewable energy integration projects, growing the grid\u2019s renewable energy capacity to approximately 19 GW.The second phase of the National Renewable Energy Program aims to develop six renewable energy projects with a total production capacity of 1.47 GW, whereas the third phase aims to develop four renewable energy projects with a total production capacity of 1.2 GW.

Outside of energy production, we have undertaken measures to operate more efficiently as an organisation too. Energy Efficiencies Through our 100% owned subsidiary, Saudi Electricity Projects Development Company, work is conducted on the engineering, design, and implementation of electricity generation and transmission projects. There is a focus on improving the performance and reliability of the electrical system through research, development, and innovation. By 2025, we aim to fully digitize the national control centre, our 8 control centres (located in the Kingdom\u2019s main cities), and to automate Energy Supply 100,000 electric switches. These efforts will improve the reliability and efficiency of the electricity network, as well as reduce network losses and facilitate network maintenance. To generate electrical power more efficiently and waste less energy during production, SEC aims to reach an overall generation fleet thermal efficiency rate of 45% by 2030. We have been making steady progress on supply-side energy efficiencies and in 2020, the thermal efficiency rate was 39.7%, slightly down from a peak of 39.9% in 2019 and considerably better than 31% achieved in 2010. SEC\u2019s direct energy use during 2020 was 317 million barrels of oil equivalent (mboe), representing a 3.3% decrease since 2019. Since 2017 improvements have reduced our direct energy consumption by 11.5%. Our fuel consumption was 1.73 barrels of oil per mWh in 2020, representing a 1.1% increase compared to 2019, however, we plan to reduce our fuel consumption to 1.4 barrels/mWh by 2024.

An additional 3.2 GW of capacity mostly from additional IPPs/IWPPs and other producers, enhanced our total generation capability. New transmission stations with overhead lines and underground cables strengthened our transmission networks with investment of SAR 64 billion in generation, transmission, and distribution projects. Furthermore, the capital commitments which comprise the unexecuted portion of capital contracts for the construction and installation of power plants and other gird assets amounted to SAR 47 billion. We plan and implement measures to influence the way electrical energy is consumed. Our efforts attempt to reduce overall energy consumption, reduce consumption during peak consumption hours, and shift consumption to low- demand periods (off-peak hours). Energy Demand The Smart Meter Project (SMP), launched during 2019, is a key enabler of digitalization in the Kingdom. Valued over SAR 9.7 billion, the project successfully installed approximately 10 million smart meters as of February 2021. The large-scale roll-out of these smart meters is part of our efforts to increase the reliability and efficiency of our distribution networks, which will enable SEC to significantly improve its accuracy in monitoring consumption, improve service quality, enhance customer satisfaction, optimize the use of natural and financial Smart Meter Project resources, improve demand-side management, and improve overall access to electricity. It is estimated the SMP can reduce energy consumption by 1% per smart meter and will significantly reduce the number of operations- related field trips. Over 100 million electro-mechanical meter reading trips, as well as over 1 million trips related to disconnect and reconnect, can potentially be avoided annually. The project also supports local manufacturers and capacity building. By sourcing approximately 3.5 million smart meters from local manufacturers, we are directly supporting local technical capacity building and the creation of new manufacturing industries throughout the Kingdom. The SMP is currently in its final phase of integrating it functionalities with the relevant telecom infrastructure services and is expected to be completed by the end of 2021.Throughout our offices, we have implemented a variety of energy optimization standards and practices. Modern technical solutions enable us to better manage our electricity consumption, such as automatically shutting down power at specific times and during inactivity and using more energy efficient equipment. Our SEC headquarters in Riyadh, completed Fleet Management Smart BuildingsBetween 2017 and 2020, we have been able to reduce our fleets by 630 vehicles and 174 items of heavy equipment. From 2019 to 2020, we reduced our gasoline and diesel fuel consumption by 17% and 42%, respectively. This resulted in reducing our CO2 emissions by approximately 10% from 2019 and 33% from 2017. Moreover, we encourage the adoption of electric vehicles through our vehicle charging points installed at our headquarters, which are free to use by employees. in 2019, has been designed in compliance with the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) green building standards. The building\u2019s design is energy efficient, uses thermal insulation materials, and partially operates on renewable energy and recycled wastewater. As a result, our overall renewable energy consumption has increased significantly since 2017 and our overall electricity consumption has steadily decreased. Due to COVID-19 related factors, both our renewable energy and overall electricity consumption decreased significantly in 2020 when compared to 2019 and previous years.",

        "content": "2020 ESG REPORT 2020 ESG REPORT32 33 Our power plants, specifically those that run on steam, require significant amounts of water to operate. Through our Environmental Policy, and in compliance with environmental regulations, we strive to reduce water consumption and pollution. The sea water we use is mostly untreated, except for chlorine to prevent algae and microorganism growth, and is used to cool turbines or as fire water. To meet the requirements of the GAMEP , we conduct regular sampling and monitoring of our seawater discharge. We also desalinate sea water for various operational activities, which is stored in tanks and is pH regulated before being discharged with cooling or rainwater, as per GAMEP regulations. Other water uses relate to our cleaning units and boilers, which includes adding chemicals like soda and sodium sulphide. To Water Consumption and Pollution avoid discharge of chemicals to the sea, this water is collected and stored in evaporation pools. For water contaminated with oils and fuels, a separator unit removes oils from the contaminated water. Wastewater is sent back to the oil separator pool, while the recovered oil is used as fuel. We do not discharge sewage water into the environment. It is either treated in a power plant\u2019s sewage treatment station or transported to a central treatment facility. Treating and reusing sewage water enables SEC to reduce its water consumption, for example, biologically treated water can irrigate green areas within our facilities. Finally, our PP10 and PP12 generation power plants in Riyadh use treated and imported sewage water. Designing power plants to accept other water types has helped combined cycle units to become available for energy production in all regions of the Kingdom, having previously been limited to coastal regions. To effectively monitor and reduce SEC\u2019s water consumption throughout its 3,896 buildings, spread across 493 locations, our audit teams periodically check all locations. Such audits ensure water consumption is appropriately managed, especially in terms of measuring consumption and water economy. In 2020, our total water consumption increased by 8.8% in comparison to 2019 and the percentage of water we recycled and reused remained at over 90%, a trend that has continued for at least 5 consecutive years.

This fly ash is collected using electrostatic precipitators and moved to silos for temporary storage. The Company is embarking on a transformation program to identify ways to convert carbon ash from a hazardous substance into a revenue generating material. Due to its harmful effects on the environment, carbon ash is expensive to safely dispose of in a landfill. We are working with research centres, such as Memorial University Canada, to investigate the possibility of separating valuable metals from carbon ash, Hazardous waste including vanadium, nickel, or active carbon, and are exploring its potential for water purification and the treatment of gas emissions from boilers. We have an agreement with Al- Safwa Cement to use carbon ash as an alternative fuel in their production, in accordance with the requirements of the GAMEP . This relationship has contributed to saving over SAR 47 million per year on disposal costs, helped the cement factory with a reported 20% energy savings, and will transport over 200,000 cubic meters of carbon ash from the Shuaiba stations, Rabigh, South Jeddah, and Shakeek. Moreover, this project won the \u201cGreat Idea of the Year\u201d award at the 13th International Conference 2018 in Dubai and was nominated for the Global Ideas award. Due to this success, we aim to extend the scope of this project and seek further collaboration with other cement companies. For the other forms of hazardous waste we generate, such as waste oil and various chemicals, this waste is appropriately collected and processed by specialized waste contractors. In our quest to improve our oil and water separation systems, we have built steaming ponds, hazardous material reservoirs, and wastewater collection systems. All municipal waste generated by our operations is safely disposed using specialized and qualified contractors. Waste management and storage at our premises involves appropriately segregating, collecting, and storing all waste before disposal. Only authorized and designated persons handle our waste and only do so using the appropriate personal protective equipment. Suitable containers are used to collect waste, which need to be appropriately secured, labelled, and stored in designated areas until they are disposed of. As of 2020, there were 16 designated waste management areas that comply with environmental standards.  An environmental monitoring program, Municipal waste which includes groundwater and air quality monitoring, is also in place for dedicated sites used to store waste .

Our CSR Policy guides the implementation of programs and initiatives aimed towards our employees, society, partners, customers, and other key stakeholders to maximize our positive impacts and to maintain our social license to operate. Throughout 2020, we planned multiple CSR initiatives including electrical safety campaigns, environmental campaigns, volunteer campaigns, blood donation campaigns, charity donation drives, various social agreements, patient hospital visits, a Ramadan breakfast, Hajj Community Investment season activities, and a variety of international days. Each CSR activity has an associated target and unfortunately, due to COVID-19 factors, our implementation plans were disrupted.

We communicate with our customers and partners to ensure sustained relationships, trust and partnership, we encourage them to participate in issues of the sector. We listen to their views and suggestions to assess our performance and strengthen our position and public image.As the Kingdom\u2019s economy grows and the electrification of all aspects of life continues to expand, SEC expects its customer base to reach 10.8 million by the end of 2022.  To meet this growing electric power demand, SEC has planned and initiated numerous capacity expansion projects. For example, the addition of 3,834 MW in generation capacity to our plants, the addition of 8,600 MW in generation capacity within the private sector participation program, and by 2022, the addition of 7,560 km of circular transmission lines to lengthen and strengthen the distribution networks. Other energy access projects Access to Energy include the modernization, rehabilitation, and replacement of aging distribution network equipment, which helps to improve the reliability of the network and avoid voltage instability and outages. For example, we have extended our distribution network by approximately 4.6% year on year, adding approximately 31,812 km of new medium and low voltage cables, and increasing the network capacity by additional 12,423 MVA, which has allowed us to connect more than 384,917 new customers. To facilitate customer access to electrical services with advanced and intelligent systems, our \u2018Barq\u2019 service has reduced the lead time of electrical service delivery from 20 to 7 days. This service has contributed to reducing our average time to connect new customers from 17.9 days in 2019 to 9.9 days during 2020.

        "content": "2021 ESG REPORT5 Saudi Electricity Company (SEC) is a proud supporter of the ambitious and admirable goals established by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030. Working in collaboration with the Ministry of Energy and other local authorities, SEC is a key enabler for implementing Saudi Arabia\u2019s national energy strategy to create a sustainable electricity sector. By the year 2030, Saudi Arabia is aiming to have 50% of its electricity generated from renewable energy sources and the remaining 50% generated from thermal energy, as well as completely displacing liquid fuel for gas. We sincerely look forward to continuing to support Saudi Arabia\u2019s leadership and working with all of SEC\u2019s key stakeholders towards the achievement of these goals. To promote the integration of renewable energy and to reduce the generation of greenhouse gas emissions, we have committed to investing over $3 billion into 25 renewable energy integration projects by the year 2026, which will have a total capacity of 15,994 megawatts and the potential to avoid 33.5 megatons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions each year. Our Smart Meter Project (SMP), valued at over $2.56 billion and responsible for successfully implementing over 10.5 million smart meters throughout Saudi Arabia, has the potential to avoid 1.8 million tons of CO2e emissions each year, as well as helping to promote grid digitization and creating multiple benefits for our customers. Becoming a customer centric organization that provides world-class services is one of our key strategic goals, and we continued to strategize and invest into our product and service offerings throughout 2021. We have been driving digitization and the automation of the grid, especially through our new customer experience strategy, SMP , Digital Transformation for Customer Service Program, and Customer Experience Transformation Program. Our customer satisfaction ratings continue to improve each year, including other customer satisfaction metrics such as the average time to connect a customer and the average amount of service disruption experienced per customer. As Saudi Arabia and the rest of the world acclimated to the COVID-19 pandemic during 2021, SEC welcomed a return to previous operational norms. Our employees received an average of 28.3 hours of training, a 104% increase compared to 2020 and a return to normal training levels. The number of emergency drills and simulations we conducted increased by 53% during CEO Message Khalid H. Al-Gnoon Khalid H.

Encouragingly, the number of employee injuries decreased by 25% compared to 2020, and we endeavour to ensure this trend continues by investigating and learning from all health and safety incidents when they occur. SEC\u2019s Board Committee on Health, Safety, Security, Environment and Sustainability has been the driving force in monitoring and strategically guiding our actions in numerous environmental, social and governance (ESG) areas. To help this Committee fulfil its responsibilities, we formed a new Executive ESG Committee, chaired by myself, and we are excited to improve SEC\u2019s ESG performance in the years to come. In conclusion, I would like to sincerely thank Saudi Arabia\u2019s leadership, the members of the Board of Directors, my colleagues, all employees, and all remaining SEC stakeholders for their significant contributions and efforts towards helping SEC fulfil its ESG ambitions. On behalf of SEC, I officially welcome you to our third annual ESG report, which provides an in-depth analysis and discussion of SEC\u2019s ESG progress up until the end of 2021. I hope you find this report insightful and I encourage you to engage with us to improve our ESG reporting in the future.Facilitating the Transition to a Low Carbon and Circular EconomyEmpowering People and CommunitiesEnabling Responsible Business Practices CEO Message2021 ESG REPORT 4 Facilitating the Transition to a Low Carbon and Circular EconomyEmpowering People and CommunitiesEnabling Responsible Business Practices",

        "content": "2021 ESG REPORT9 History In 1975, the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia established the Ministry of Industry and Electricity to regulate the electricity sector. Following subsequent name changes to this Ministry, Saudi Arabia was segregated into five operating regions (i.e.: Western, Eastern, Central, Southern and Northern) that received electricity supplies from regional private and semi-private utility companies. Most of these utility companies were eventually consolidated into four majority state-owned utility companies, collectively known as the Saudi Consolidated Electricity Companies (SCECOs). In the Northern Region of Saudi Arabia, the responsibility for overseeing the previously private and semi-private utility companies located within the region was given to the General Electricity Corporate (GEC). Following additional reforms to the electricity sector, SEC was established in the year 2000 and subsequently incorporated as a joint stock company. With its headquarters in Riyadh, all SCECOs and GEC were merged under SEC, which became responsible for all associated operations, rights and liabilities. The five operating regions were eventually merged into four operating regions: Western Region \u2013 SEC departments cover Makkah, Jeddah Madinah, Tabuk and Taif. Eastern Region \u2013 SEC departments cover Dammam and Al Ahsa, the Northern province, the Al-Jouf province and the northern border. Central Region \u2013 SEC departments cover Riyadh City and the provinces of Riyadh, Qassim, Alkharj, Dawadme and Hail. Southern Region \u2013 SEC departments cover the Asir, Jizan, Najran and Baha provinces.

        "content": "2021 ESG REPORT13 Key ways we have been developing a sustainable energy sector include: Creating a smart grid installing over 10.4 million new smart meters throughout Saudi Arabia during 2020 and 2021. Improving fuel efficiencies conducting research into advancing and developing highly efficient combustion technologies. Liquid fuel displacement striving to generate electricity by displacing liquid fuels with gas. Renewable energy investment and interconnection investing approximately SAR 7.1 billion into renewable energy integration projects and growing the grid\u2019s renewable energy capacity to approximately 19 GW by 2025. Automated customer services launching our Digital Transformation for Customer Service Program. Our ambition for a sustainable energy sector also supports Saudi Arabia\u2019s National Transformation Program. Launched in 2016, this program aims to develop the necessary infrastructure and create an environment that enables the public, private and non-profit sectors to achieve Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030.REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT Comprehensive regulatory and financial reforms for the electricity sector in Saudi Arabia were approved by a Royal order in November, 2020. These reforms fall under the supervision of the Supreme Committee for Energy Mix Affairs for Electricity Production and Enabling Renewable Energy Sector, which is headed by His Royal Highness, Crown Prince, Deputy Prime Minister, and Chairman of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz. The approved reforms, listed below, help to address multiple financial-related challenges experienced by SEC and the electricity sector: \u2022 Cancelling the Government fee imposed on SEC by Royal order No. 14006 dated 23/03/1439 AH, as of 01/01/ 2021. \u2022 Adopting the minimum operating costs model to determine the required revenue for the 2020 fiscal year, provided that this required revenue shall cover all operating and financing costs, including the distribution of dividends due to all shareholders, including the Public Investment Fund. \u2022 Adopting the Regulatory Asset-Based (RAB) Model, starting from the 2021 fiscal year, as a mechanism to regulate SEC\u2019s revenue. There will be a regulated return according to the weighted average cost of capital specified in the letter of (6%). \u2022 Reclassification of the net financial obligations owed to the government by SEC. Benefits of the RAB Model for SEC: \u2022 Becoming a financially sustainable Company by meeting operational expenses, fulfilling financial obligations to stakeholders, and providing equity returns to all shareholders. \u2022 Insultation from multiple risks, including those associated with electricity demand, tariffs and fuel prices; especially through existing pass-through and revenue-correction mechanisms (balancing account) that compensate SEC for differences between required and actual revenues. \u2022 Incentivizes SEC to incur capital expenditure on regulatory assets and to maintain service reliability. \u2022 Setting operating expenditure metrics to enable SEC to provide benchmark quality service. \u2022 Incentivises efficiency through various parameters relating to SEC\u2019s capital and operating expenditure. As a result, SEC has been able to strengthen its balance sheet and cash flow, as well as recover operational costs, earn a fair rate of return on investments, and fulfil all financial obligations, including fuel payments, purchased power payments, and distributing dividends to all shareholders that were previously excluded. 2021 ESG REPORT 12 Facilitating the Transition to a Low Carbon and Circular EconomyEmpowering People and CommunitiesEnabling Responsible Business Practices",

        "content": "2021 ESG REPORT15 In alignment with Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030 and its strategic pillars for developing the electricity sector, the intentions of the reforms are to ensure the long- term health, sustainability and efficiency of Saudi Arabia\u2019s electricity sector. The expected outcomes include more efficient power generation; complete displacement of liquid fuels by both gas and renewable energy capacities in electricity production; and increased environmental protection. The reforms will also aim to increase the reliability of Saudi Arabia\u2019s electricity transmission network to facilitate the production of electricity from renewable energy sources, which supports Saudi Arabia in continuously optimizing and diversifying its energy mix. Efforts to increase the reliability of the electricity transmission network will also be supplemented by improved distribution networks, which will further enhance supply reliability to all consumers. Another important regulatory development is the transfer of ownership of the Saudi Power Procurement Company (SPPC) from SEC to Saudi Arabia\u2019s Government. Dated 18/04/1443H, SEC received a letter from His Royal Highness the Minister of Energy, Chairman of the Ministerial Committee for the Restructuring of the Electricity Sector, approving all necessary legal procedures to purchase and transfer the ownership of SPPC. This transfer of ownership is a part of Saudi Arabia\u2019s comprehensive electricity reforms to help improve efficiency and quality of electric service. As SPPC oversees the competitive tendering of renewable and conventional energy projects, it helps to supply growing local electricity demands, it effectively manages procurement and sale of power agreements, and it procures and provides fuel while striving to increase fuel efficiencies. For further information on the regulatory changes occurring within Saudi Arabia\u2019s electricity sector, please refer to our 2021 Board of Directors Report. Ensuring the provision of safe, adequate, high quality and efficient electricity supply to all consumers. Increasing efficiencies to reduce the costs of providing electrical service. Raising the quality of electrical service and focusing on consumer satisfaction.

These laws cover numerous areas, including prohibiting the pollution and contamination of air, land, and water, as well as noise pollution.Environmental Governance All new projects require an environmental permit prior to construction, operation and closure. Any new project with an environmental impact must undergo an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) that is approved by the National Center for Environmental Compliance (NCEC). The outcomes of EIA\u2019s submitted to the NCEC for approval can vary. The NCEC may reject the permit application, grant unconditional NCEC consent, or grant NCEC consent subject to such conditions as it considers necessary to address its concerns. Where conditional NCEC consent is granted, the applicant must fulfil the stated conditions as a prerequisite to the granting of any such environmental permit. The NCEC also regularly sends inspectors to SEC\u2019s facilities to ensure we complying with all environmental guidelines and laws. In our Environmental Policy, we recognize that our business activities (including those of our subsidiaries) can impact the environment and that we have a responsibility to minimize these impacts, as well as comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. A key element of this policy is to balance the need to promote sustainable development while simultaneously meeting the electricity needs of our customers. To help us achieve this aim, we strive to: \u2022 Integrate environmental considerations into business and decision-making processes.\u2022 Pursue more efficient use of resources within the business, including an increased focus on the reuse and recycling of resources and on waste minimization measures. \u2022 Promote clean energy and adopt the best practical technologies and the most suitable options to minimize the adverse impacts on the environment, which may result from SEC activities. \u2022 Monitor, measure, and assess the environmental performance of our facilities, processes, products and services. \u2022 Ensure that our employees are aware of, and engaged with, our environmental commitments and that they have the necessary competencies and equipment to operate in line with these obligations and commitments. \u2022 Communicate our commitments to our contractors and suppliers, and work to ensure that they are addressing these as part of their engagement with our organization. \u2022 Educate, and engage with, our customers to increase their awareness of environmental issues and enable them to make more energy efficient choices. \u2022 Ensure that the necessary personnel, equipment, and procedures are in place to safely, promptly, and effectively respond to any incidents associated with our facilities and operations. As a part of our continuous commitment towards the environment, our Environmental Policy was recently reviewed with an aim to ensure it is still appropriate and to enhance any areas, if needed. The Environmental Compliance Committee strives to ensure that SEC complies with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. The Committee, comprising representatives from each major business line, meets on a quarterly basis, has established environmental compliance requirements for each business line and reports on SEC\u2019s overall environmental compliance levels. To ensure SEC complies with established environmental standards, over 200 Environmental Protection Coordinators have been assigned across all Company sites. To help SEC maintain its levels of environmental compliance, as well as address the areas that do not currently comply with environmental standards, various environmental programs have either been established or are currently being developed and launched. All projects at SEC are designed to comply with Saudi Arabia\u2019s environmental laws and regulations. In addition to these compliant designs, over half of our 42 power plant sites have obtained ISO 14001 (Environmental Management System), ISO 9001 (Quality Management System) and ISO 19600 (Compliance Management System) certifications. We continue to pursue the same certifications and licenses for all remaining sites, and we have also engaged with an environmental contractor to helpy us deploy corrective action plans across our sites during 2022.Conducting environmental compliance audits and submitting regular reports to the relevant legislative authorities enable us to objectively assess key elements of our overall environmental performance. In accordance with ISO 19011 guidelines for auditing management systems, we conduct regular environmental compliance audits across our operations. Quarterly environmental compliance reports are submitted to the relevant legislative authorities and we organize regular field visits related to meeting our financing obligations in accordance with the World Bank. For all instances of non-conformance with environmental standards, corrective action plans are developed and regularly monitored. To further help us monitor our environmental performance, we implemented an automated system for environmental protection during 2021.  The system operates 24 hours a day and seven days a week, and consists of three main elements: \u2022 Generating environmental compliance reports. \u2022 An environmental auditing system. \u2022 Monitoring environmental indicators. This new system has enabled us to increase the scope and accuracy of the environmental-related data we collect, increase our efficiencies in preparing environmental compliance reports, and improve how we engage and involve our site managers in environmental compliance activities. 2021 ESG REPORT 24 Facilitating the Transition to a Low Carbon and Circular EconomyEmpowering People and CommunitiesEnabling Responsible Business Practices",

Supporting Renewable Energy In alignment with the Saudi Green Initiative, an ambition which aims to achieve a reduction in carbon emissions by greater than 278 Mtpa by 2030, as well as achieve net zero emissions by 2060 through five key initiatives, SEC has been supporting the development and deployment of renewable energy throughout Saudi Arabia. In the past, we have commissioned various renewable energy projects and we continue to support the development of electric power plants with integrated renewable energy. In 2011, we commissioned the first ever grid-connected and solar photovoltaic (SPV) project with Showa Shell in Farsan. In 2017, we commissioned a 2.75-MW wind turbine with General Electric in Huriamla. Two Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contracts have been entered into by SEC to develop electric powerplants integrated with solar thermal energy: Up until the year 2026, we have committed or planned over $3 bn in investments (spending budget) for 25 renewable interconnection projects, integrating a total capacity of 15,994 megawatts with the potential to avoid 33.5 Mt CO2e in emissions each year. 13 renewable interconnection projects are currently under construction, of which on is already operational.

        "content": "2021 ESG REPORT33 Efficient Energy Management Effectively managing and improving efficiencies for both electricity production (supply) and consumption (demand) enables SEC to reduce the GHG emissions associated with its operating model, as well as save costs and be more efficient in meeting overall energy needs. Key ways we have been improving our energy supply efficiencies include the digitization of control centres, improving the thermal efficiency rate of our generation fleet, and improving the reliability and performance of the overall electrical system. By digitizing the national control centre and our 8 control centres by 2025, including the automation of approximately 100,000 electric switches, this will reduce network losses, improve reliability and facilitate network maintenance. By aiming to achieve an overall generation fleet thermal efficiency rate of 45% by 2030, this will enable SEC to generate electricity more efficiently and reduce wasted energy during production processes. For the past five years, our thermal efficiency rate has averaged 39.51% and in 2021, our thermal efficiency rate was 39.30%, which is slightly lower in comparison to the past three years. Through the Saudi Electricity Projects Development Company, a wholly owned subsidiary of SEC, there is a focus on improving the electrical system\u2019s overall performance and reliability through research, development and innovation. Over the past five years, our total energy consumption has averaged 471.1 million barrels of oil equivalent (mboe). Compared to 2020, our total energy consumption increased by approximately 3% to 472.01 mboe due to growing power demand, whereas our energy intensity, in terms of total energy consumed per megawatt hour of electricity sold, remained at similar levels to previous years at 1.62 barrels of oil per megawatt hour sold. By 2024, we aim to reduce our energy intensity to 1.4 barrels of oil per megawatt hour sold.Encouragingly, the renewable energy produced by IPPs and IWPPs have been increasing each year. In 2021, the renewable energy produced by IPPs/IWPPs was approximately 1,000 gigawatt hours, representing a 1,508% increase from the 62.2 gigawatt hours produced in 2019, which was due to the complete integration of the SKAKA PV solar power plant. Through renewable energy offtake agreements where SEC has agreed in advance to purchase the renewable energy generated by a producer, SEC continues to support the development and expansion of the grid\u2019s renewable energy capacity. In 2017, through Saudi Power Purchase Company (SPPC), a wholly owned SEC subsidiary, SEC entered into its first 25-year Power Purchasing Agreement (PPA) between ACWA Power and SPPC. In 2019, SEC entered into a 20-year PPA with the Doumat Al-Jandel wind farm project, which has a capacity of 400 megawatts, and in 2021, SEC entered into a 25-year PPA with the Sudair Solar project, which has a capacity of 1,500 megawatts. On the 29th of November, 2021, SEC publicly announced that received a letter from His Royal Highness the Minister of Energy, Chairman of the Ministerial Committee for the Restructuring of the Electricity Sector, approving all necessary legal procedures to purchase and transfer the ownership of SPPC. This resolution comes as part of the electricity sector\u2019s restructuring program and is a continuation of the regulatory and structural reforms announced on the 15th of November, 2020, by the Ministerial Committee for the Restructuring of the Electricity Sector, with oversight of the Supreme Committee for energy mix for the electricity generation and empowering renewable energy sector, headed by His Royal Highness the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz - Deputy Prime Minister and Chairman of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs. The intentions of this resolution are to reinforce transparent commercial relations among the electricity system players, as well as helping the sector to operate on economic fundamentals. The resolution will help Saudi Arabia in achieving its electricity sector objectives, including lower usage of liquid fuels for electricity production, increased environmental protection, and increasing the reliability of electricity transmission and the distribution grid, which will facilitate the production of electricity from renewable energy sources to help achieve the optimal energy mix for electricity production, as well as improving and automating the distribution networks. All of which will help to enhance the quality of electricity services provided to consumers and contribute towards the ambitions of Vision 2030.

The project will also significantly reduce the number of operations related field trips. Over 100 million electro- mechanical meter reading trips, as well as over 1 million trips related to disconnect and reconnect, can potentially be avoided annually. SEC estimated an additional CO2 emission avoided of 376.37 tCO2 eq  to be observed thanks to meter reading truck rolls. The emissions avoided have been estimated by taking the annual fuel consume (gallons) and applying the emission per gallon of gasoline consumed2. The fuel consumed is calculated by multiplying fuel efficiency by distance covered. The distance covered was calculated by multiplying the number of truck rolls by distance covered per truck roll3. *Renewable Energy (Integration of renewables): Not allocated to the Greek Sukuk at this moment. ** Pro-rated to allocated proceeds Notes to impact reporting a/ Signed amount represents the amount legally committed by SEC for the project, a portfolio of projects or component that is/are eligible for green bond financing. b/ This is the share of the total portfolio per eligible category. c/ This is the share of the total portfolio costs that is eligible for financing. d/ This represents the amount of green bond proceeds that has been allocated for disbursements to the project/ portfolio. e/ Project life based on the expected financial life of the project. f/ Impact reporting indicators per eligible category - methodology and assumptions used: 2Emissions per gallon of guel (MT/Gallons) is 0.008887 metric tons CO2/gallon of gasoline. 3Distance covered per truck roll= (daily meter reads/ number of meters per km) multiplied by 2 to account of round trip.INFLUENCING ENERGY DEMAND SEC seeks to positively influence the way electricity is consumed. By helping customers to reduce their overall electricity consumption, reduce the electricity consumed during peak consumption hours, and shifting electricity consumption patterns towards low-demand periods (off-peak), this positions SEC to more effectively and efficiently meet Saudi Arabia\u2019s growing electricity demand. An important way SEC intends to positively influence electricity demand is through the use of Smart Meters. Launched in 2019, SEC has successfully installed over 10.5 million smart meters throughout Saudi Arabia through a Smart Meter Project (SMP) valued at over SAR 9.7 billion. The SMP has enabled SEC to monitor electricity consumption more effectively, improve service quality and customer satisfaction, optimize resource consumption (e.g.: oil, financial), improve electricity demand management and increase access to electricity. The estimated reduction in overall energy consumption is 1% per smart meter, which will lead to significant annual reductions in electromechanical meter reading trips (approximately 100 million), disconnection trips and reconnection trips (approximately over one million for both).

From the seawater we consume, it is mostly untreated except for the chlorine we add to prevent algae and microorganism growth. Desalinated water is used for a range of operational activities. We also import, treat and consume sewage water in our PP10 and PP12 generation power plants based in Riyadh. These power plants, designed to accept other types of water, have helped to increase the availability of energy production in combined cycle units, which were previously limited to coastal regions. We take care to ensure the water we discharge is in compliance with local regulatory requirements. In accordance with the requirements stated by the Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture, the seawater we discharge is regularly sampled and monitored, and the desalinated water we discharge is pH regulated and discharged with cooling or rainwater. The water we use for cleaning units and boilers, which often has chemicals added to it like soda and sodium sulphate, is collected and stored in evaporation ponds. Water contaminated with oils and/or fuels is sent to a separator unit or oil separator pool, where the oil is recovered and used as fuel. We do not discharge any sewage water, it is either treated in a power plant\u2019s sewage treatment station or transported to a central treatment facility. To help SEC understand how effective it is at managing and reducing its overall water consumption, regular water consumption-related audits across all locations. In 2021, the total volume of water we consumed was 6,403,192 m3, representing a decrease compared to 2020. The percentage of water we recycle or reuse has averaged 92.74% over the past five years, and in 2021, we recycled or reused 88.18% of the total water we consumed.Appropriate Resource Management SEC is committed to protecting the environment and biodiversity. As highlighted in our Environmental Policy, we strive to appropriately manage the resources used throughout our operations by pursuing the efficient use of resources, including an increased focus on the reuse and recycling of resources, as well as waste minimization measures. For all new projects initiated by SEC, each must undergo an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) in accordance with NCEC standards. To understand and assess the impacts we have on local ecosystems, we conduct semi-annual marine surveys along Saudi Arabia\u2019s coastal areas. During 2021, 22 EIA studies and environmental reviews were conducted for new projects and existing generation and transmission facilities. An EIA helps us to assess a wide variety of potential impact areas, including air, soil, water, noise, waste, ecology, biodiversity and socioeconomic aspects. Should an impact be considered too great, alternative project approaches will be pursued that include additional mitigation measures to avoid, minimize and/or remedy (compensate) an impact. The semi-annual marine surveys we conduct are for all our coastal power stations, including those located in Rabigh, Shuaiba, Ghazalan and The Village. We have also participated in an aquaculture project at our Jeddah South power plant, as well as a pilot project in cooperation with GenosTech at our Rabigh power plant, which was used to determine the impacts we were having on aquaculture and microalgae. The aim of the Jeddah South power plant aquaculture project was to find an appropriate environment to promote the growth and preservation of unique coral reefs found in the Red Sea. Through collaborations with three other organizations, the project involved the deployment of 500 units of artificial coral reefs over a two-month period from June to July, 2018.  Since deployment, we continue to regularly monitor the growth of marine organisms, such as algae, sponge, plants, Tunicates and some soft corals.

        "content": "2021 ESG REPORT43 Waste Management To complement our Environmental Policy, a Waste Management Procedure governs the management of all types of waste generated across SEC\u2019s sites. The procedure includes a description of waste management strategies and outlines how all waste materials must be appropriately handled and stored. A key element of our waste management strategies is to procure materials that will not create negative environmental impacts and to favour environmentally friendly products, where possible. The main type of hazardous waste that we generate is carbon ash (also known as fly ash), other types of hazardous waste include waste oil and a variety of chemicals. For the carbon ash we generate, which originates from the combustion activities within our power plants, it is collected by electrostatic precipitators and temporarily stored in silos. For the other types of hazardous waste we generate, specialized waste contractors collect and process this waste. Since carbon ash can cause negative environmental impacts, we have been exploring ways to safely transport and/or use this material. Working with the Memorial University of Canada and other research centres, we have been researching into separating valuable metals from carbon ash, such as vanadium, nickel, or active carbon, and are also exploring applications for water purification and the treatment of gas emissions from boilers. We have also entered into an agreement with Al-Safwa Cement to use our carbon ash as an alternative fuel in their production processes. This agreement has resulted in cost savings of over SAR 47 million per year in disposal costs, reduced the energy consumed by the relevant cement factory by 20%, and the transport of over 200,000 cubic meters of carbon ash. The non-hazardous waste we generate (municipal waste) is collected and appropriately disposed of by qualified waste contractors. To effectively and safely handle this waste, at least 16 designated waste management areas have been established that comply with set environmental standards, all municipal waste is appropriately segregated and stored in suitable containers, and only authorized and designated personnel can handle the waste we generate. To further monitor and mitigate against the inherent risks involved with waste management practices, an environmental monitoring program has been established for all SEC sites used to store waste, which includes monitoring groundwater and air quality. To mitigate against the risk of soil contamination specifically, we have implemented a range of measures throughout our operations, including: Developing and applying programs to reduce spills and leakages.Replacing ecologically damaging insecticides with less harmful alternatives. Removing power transformers with carcinogenic oils, such as polychlorinated biphenyl.Using qualified contractors to remove petroleum and oil residues from generating plants. Replacing oils in electrical switches with sulphur hexafluoride (SF6), a potent isolation gas.Collaborating with local and international universities and research centres to create suitable solutions for carbonic ashes. Using dry cured cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE) cables instead of oily cables.Implementation of sewage collection systems at 53 sites. Over the past five years, the total amount of waste we have generated has averaged 443,779 tons per year. In 2021, the total waste we generated was 211,618 tons, representing an 8% decrease compared to 2020. Encouragingly, the percentage of the waste we recycled through our generation activities continued to increase for the fifth consecutive year.

Each employee receives an annual and associated individual development plan. Through a competency-based learning approach, training courses and individual support is provided. An online training portal is also available for our employees to take advantage of and contains hundreds of interactive courses. By the end of 2021, we had delivered a total of 933,738 training hours to our employees, which represents a 100% increase in comparison to 2020. This significant increase stems from a resumption of the training activities previously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar increases were recorded in other training metrics too. The average hours of training received by each employee increased by 104% to 28.3 hours, which is similar to the average hours of training received by our employees in 2018 and 2019. Executive & Leadership Training We offer a range of training programs to help our current and future leaders to refine their skill sets and further develop their roles as leaders within the Company. Most of these programs have been developed based on, or at least incorporate, six behavioural/ leadership competencies. Depending on the level of leadership training needed, which includes \u2018Leading Self\u2019, \u2018Leading Others\u2019, \u2018Leading Teams\u2019 or \u2018Leading the Organization\u2019, an appropriate training program will be developed for the respective employee. Examples of these training programs include: \u2022 Master\u2019s programs at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). \u2022 Various courses in partnership with the International Institute for Management Development (IMD), including inspirational leadership, strategy execution, crisis management, disruptive innovation, and orchestrating winning performance. \u2022 Executive and Leadership Development Center (ELDC) to help prepare targeted leaders and those who have leadership potential to assume future leadership positions. \u2022 Internal leadership programs developed and offered through our Targeted Talent Program (TTP). \u2022 One-on-one leadership coaching. \u2022 Conducting peak assessments.During 2021, all management-level and above employees received 90,972 hours of training, representing a 74% increase compared to 2020. This increase in training again relates to the resumption of training programs previously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, 130 of our leaders participated in a peak assessment, and for SEC\u2019s top 400 leaders, each are participating in one of four mandatory leadership programs. Development of Nationals & Other Types of Training Due to the high numbers of local nationals employed by SEC, most of the training and development programs we offer are inherently designed for local nationals. For recent Saudi Arabian university graduates, we offer two types of programs: \u2022 A two-year development program to assist in the development of professional and administrative competencies. \u2022 A qualification and training program for graduates of technical colleges, secondary schools or industrial high schools. To help local nationals learn and develop skills for specialized functions, such as the management of electrical systems or understanding new technological developments for our industry, we offer a Saudi Expertise Development Program. Other forms of training offered includes short- term development courses (e.g.: technical, administrative and professional), on-the-job training, e-learning and a cooperative trainer program, which aims to improve the experience of employees in technical and administrative areas. During 2021, all non-management employees received an average of 27.3 hours of training, representing a 107% increase compared to 2020.

Over the past three years, we have been distributing biannual employee engagement surveys to all employees. These surveys inform the development of an Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS), a measure used by organizations to better understand overall employee satisfaction and loyalty levels, and help us to identify areas that can be improved. Our eNPS was 6.5 in 2021, representing an improvement of 0.5 compared to 2020, and moves us closer to the global benchmark of 7.3. Our 2021 employee absentee rate was similar to previous years and remained at 0.21%. SEC strives to offer competitive compensation packages and incentive programs that increase employee loyalty and attract the calibre of candidates we aim to welcome into our workforce. All compensation offered by SEC complies with the requirements of the General Organization for Social Insurance (GOSI) and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development. The ratio of our CEO\u2019s total compensation to the median full-time employee\u2019s compensation is 0.08. Benefits available to our employees include medical insurance, onsite health staff, life insurance, parental leave, retirement schemes, mortgage loans, gifts for early or normal retirement, continuous service awards, employee discount programs and annual air tickets (for non- nationals only). Our savings program for national employees aims to help them accumulate savings and various benefits to be enjoyed once retired or separated from the Company. In accordance with Islamic investment requirements, this program collects and invests voluntary employee investments. Since this program\u2019s inception, approximately 15,667 employees have participated in this program. Our housing loan program for national employees aims to provide them with loans to finance the acquisition, construction or completion of a house. These loans comply with Sharia law and can provide up to SAR 1,200,000 with a repayment term of 20 years. Since this program\u2019s inception, approximately 6,167 employees have participated in this program.Protecting Our Workforce SEC\u2019s highest priority is ensuring the health, safety and wellbeing of all employees, contractors, visitors and the general public. Guided by our Safety and Occupational Health Policy, and supported by additional and complementary policies like our Social Responsibility Policy, we are dedicated to the following: \u2022 We hold our managers and supervisors accountable to provide effective leadership of OHS in our operations, whilst recognizing that a safe behavior is the responsibility of all employees. \u2022 We identify and evaluate potential OHS risks and establish appropriate controls to minimize those risks while continuously reviewing the assessment and controls. \u2022 We provide training and development opportunities to our employees to ensure awareness and competence to manage the potential OHS risks and related responsibilities. \u2022 We communicate, consult and involve our employees in decision-making processes to continuously improve our OHS Management System. \u2022 We comply with appropriate applicable legal and other any related requirements. \u2022 We provide healthy and safe workplaces and community integration. \u2022 We establish measurable plans and objectives to improve OHS performance and integrate our management system at all levels, to reduce potential risks and enhance our services. \u2022 We document, monitor, audit, review and continuously improve our OHS performance. \u2022 We protect our employees and physical assets, ensuring business continuity. A 5-star occupational health and safety (H&S) management system has been implemented throughout our areas of operations. This system is risk-based, regularly audited and follows the internationally recognized ISO 45001 (occupational health and safety) standards. Through five pillars, the system has defined performance and monitoring requirements for: \u2022 cleanliness and tidiness in the workplace, \u2022 protective barriers for mechanical and electrical equipment, and people, \u2022 prevention of, and protection from fires, \u2022 recording incidents and inspecting them, and \u2022 safety system.

        "content": "2021 ESG REPORT55 We have established a H&S Committee to regularly monitor, address and strategize on all H&S-related matters at SEC. Part of the Committee\u2019s responsibilities include overseeing regular safety inspections across SEC\u2019s facilities. Through such inspections and other modes of monitoring, 13,636 safety observations were reported in 2021, representing a 60% increase compared to 2020. This increase stems from increased activity levels at our sites and the resumption of operating practices previously impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, the overall health and safety management systems at SEC received an 84% safety audit compliance rating from our Internal Audit Department. A significant amount of time is invested into conducting H&S training for our full-time employees and contractors. The main purpose behind this training is to cultivate a working culture that prioritizes H&S, as well as spreading awareness about H&S, ensuring our H&S systems are effective as possible, and continuous improvement. Since 2018, the total number of employees and contractors that were trained in our H&S practices each year has averaged 21,977. Compared to 2020, the total number of employees and contractors trained in our H&S practices was 29,872, representing an increase of 102%, which stems from a rebound from negative COVID-19 training impacts and an intentional focus to conduct more H&S training activities. SEC has made significant improvements in its overall H&S management practices and recognizes there are areas where further improvements are necessary. Compared to 2018, the total number of employee and contractor lost-time injuries has decreased by 66% and 14%, respectively. Unfortunately, there was an increase in the total number of contractor injuries compared to 2020 but the total number of employee injuries decreased by 25% over the same period. Each year, we try our absolute best to ensure that no fatalities occur and for 2021, we sincerely regret to inform all readers that two contractor fatalities occurred. Although this represents a meaningful improvement compared to 2020, we endeavour to ensure no fatalities occur in the future.

In 2021, the average age of our plants was over 14 years and the average availability factor was 86.1% over the past two years. We aim to maintain an average availability factor that exceeds 90%, as well as managing the number of process safety events (PSE) to within acceptable limits. A PSE can be defined as an event that releases, or loses containment of, a material that can result in health and/or environmental consequences. Disaster Management Plans have been established to prevent and reduce the likelihood of negative impacts from being incurred by the environment and society in Saudi Arabia. These plans incorporate government and site-specific requirements, and have equipped all involved sites with the necessary equipment to enable each site to effectively respond to an emergency. The sites include five main emergency command centres, five backup centres and twelve sub centres. To ensure our disaster management plans are executed as intended, all involved employees are regularly trained and assessed in response to real-life scenarios. 678 emergency drills and simulations were conducted in 2021, representing an increase of 53% when compared to 2020, which stems from a rebound from negative COVID-19 training impacts. Other ways we have ensured our disaster planning and responses are sufficient include: Updating our Disaster Risk Reduction Plans.

A master plan was developed and implemented that clarified roles and responsibilities for specific stages (readiness, response and recovery) of the Pandemic. Part of the master plan involved establishing a Pandemic Management Team with clearly defined roles and responsibilities, including those related to engaging disaster management teams, communication strategies, awareness training, reviewing and updating corporate policies, project management support, and establishing remote and secure working capabilities. Numerous measures were implemented to address the effects and risks of the Pandemic throughout SEC and its subsidiaries. Thermal cameras, both stationary and smart thermal helmets, were used to monitor and identify abnormal employee and contractor temperatures. Critical and essential jobs (61) and functions were reviewed and identified, which were targeted with precautionary measures such as work rotations and the provision of onsite accommodation. Isolation rooms (238) were prepared across 128 sites, designated for suspected incidents of positive COVID-19 cases. Personal protective equipment (PPE) and sanitizers were widely distributed. Numerous awareness campaigns were conducted, including signs, circulars, questionnaires, declarations, mobile applications and more. Additional measures included nominating Health and Safety Ambassadors, promoting social distancing, adopting curfews and closely monitoring SEC\u2019s inventory needs for planned maintenance and emergencies.

During 2020, we had planned numerous CSR activities that unfortunately had to be postponed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. These activities included various volunteering opportunities for our employees, electrical safety campaigns for our customers, blood donations, hospital visits and more. In place of these activities, we focused on helping Saudi Arabia combat the COVID-19 pandemic by donating SAR 30 million towards the Health and Endowment Fund, which accounted for nearly all of our community investments during 2020.As Saudi Arabia has acclimated itself towards the COVID-19 pandemic, we have refocused our community investments towards the types of activities we previously targeted prior to the pandemic. During 2021, these activities primarily included blood donations, beach clean-ups along both the Eastern and Western coastlines of Saudi Arabia, conducting training courses for orphans, and raising donations for various charities through our Internal Deductions Program for Sustainability and Financial Efficiency. Ultimately, the progress made by SEC throughout 2021 has helped to enable Saudi Arabia to maintain its high-levels of electricity access for its population. Since 2017, the percentage of the population with access to electricity has averaged 99.81%. Compared to 2020, this percentage increased from 99.87% to 99.93% in 2021.Addressing Energy Needs As Saudi Arabia\u2019s electricity needs continue to grow, and with SEC maintaining its position as the Country\u2019s main supplier of electricity, it is our goal to ensure that everyone has sufficient access to electricity. By the end of 2022, SEC forecasts its customer base to be approximately 10.8 million customers. We have accordingly planned the implementation of multiple generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure projects. These projects include the modernization, rehabilitation and replacement of relevant equipment too.

To continue delivering such experiences and to grow as a customer-centric organization, we developed a customer experience strategy in 2021 that we aim to fully implement by 2025. The strategy\u2019s five key goals are: 1. It is the customer\u2019s happiness in the various stages of services 2. Offering products and services 3. Customer Focus 4. Apply leading practices in customer experience 5. Digital Transformation SEC's customer experience strategy will take customer experiences to new levels and better enable SEC to fulfill its vision of becoming a customer-centric organization, as well as improving service offerings and technology solutions. Three key initiatives for our customer experience strategy include: 1. Customer Experience (CE) Transformation. This cross-business line program delivers leading CE across all customer journeys and improves customer satisfaction levels. Important elements of this program include differentiated and tailored customer services; simple and consistent \"WOW\" customer moments across key customer journeys; proactive, clear and transparent communications; and a \"Digital First\" approach with simple and intuitive user interfaces (UI) and experiences (UX) across mobile and web portals. Key benefits expected from this program include prioritized and personalized customer support (24 hours a day, 7 days a week); uniform customer experiences; and a single and consistent framework to measure and improve customer satisfaction (CSAT) levels. 2. Digital Transformation in Customer Services. This program enables and facilitates the migration of customer service-related transactions to digital channels with lower costs to serve. Important elements of this program include a revamp of our digital channels (e.g.: mobile application, web portals); introducing new digital channels, such as our chatbot; revamping CE data structures and associated governance mechanisms; deploying Artificial Intelligence (AI) led analytical capabilities; and fostering a \"new ways of working\" for digital CE products. 3. Customer Relationship Management (CRM) implementation. We are currently in the process of replacing our existing CRM program with a leading and cloud-based SAP solution. Examples of the types of customer-centric initiatives that were implemented throughout 2021 include: \u2022 Provisioning of services through our WhatsApp number 920001100, which includes the ability to check billing and account information, view service disruption reports, submit complaints and more. \u2022 Upgrading our Chatbot service to be more user- friendly and incorporating the ability to submit complaints. \u2022 A trial launch of the \u2018Adadi\u2019 platform, which aims to link a customer\u2019s electric meter with other government agencies to facilitate the exchanging of data for the customer\u2019s benefit. \u2022 An \u2018Aamin\u2019 service, which allows its applicants to safely conduct work close to the electrical grid. 2021 ESG REPORT 60 Facilitating the Transition to a Low Carbon and Circular EconomyEmpowering People and CommunitiesEnabling Responsible Business Practices",

One area where our performance dropped slightly was in the time taken to resolve all customer complaints. Compared to 2020, it took us nearly two extra days to resolve the customer complaints we received throughout 2021.

Two key measures we have implemented to appropriately manage our cybersecurity practices include the establishment of a standalone Cybersecurity Function in 2020, as well as a Data Management and Governance Office in 2021. The Cybersecurity Function reports directly to our CEO and further underscores how serious cybersecurity is considered at SEC. The Data Management and Governance Office was established in response to a requirement from the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA), which has been given a core mandate to drive and own Saudi Arabia\u2019s data and AI agenda to help achieve Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030 goals. By the end of 2024, all entities within Saudi Arabia will be required to comply with SDAIA\u2019s regulations, as well as those issued by the National Cybersecurity Authority. In order to prepare SEC to meet these future regulatory requirements, as well as improve SEC\u2019s current levels of compliance, a data management strategy has been established that will incorporate the following key elements: Some of the key ways we have been addressing our data privacy needs as an organization include ISO certifications, risk assessments, continuous monitoring systems, awareness raising activities and conducting regular internal audits on our information security and data privacy practices. We have certified numerous technology services with ISO 27001 standards, an internationally recognized set of standards that provides the requirements for an information security management system. Operational Technology (OT) Risk Assessments are regularly conducted to understand the types of cyber risks present and to assess the appropriateness of established mitigation measures. A Security Operation Center has been created to continuously monitor both of our Information Technology and OT systems. Our awareness raising practices for information security and data privacy all share the same goal of helping our employees to understand their role in reducing data breaches. All employees involved in data processing operations are required to sign a non-disclosure and confidentiality undertaking. Through email messages, screen savers, social media channels and cybersecurity bulletins, important cybersecurity and data privacy messages are communicated. Training sessions are conducted for our employees, including those based in the Central, Eastern, Southern and Western (COA, EOA, SOA, WOA) operating regions. Since 2020, there have been zero data privacy breaches, losses of customer data, or complaints received concerning breaches of customer privacy.

As stated in our Code of Conduct & Ethics, SEC will only conduct business with suppliers and contractors that comply with all local, and if applicable, international laws and regulations, as well as any additional standards defined by SEC relating to labour, health, safety, environment or as deemed necessary. Each supplier and contractor are thus required to sign an acknowledgement (i.e.: Commitment to the Code of Conduct and Ethics), stating they understand the provisions stated in our Code of Conduct & Ethics and are committed to abide by them. To promote fair and competitive opportunities among our suppliers and contractors, we maintain a procedure for registering and qualifying suppliers and have implemented an e-Bidding system.  Our procedure covers key areas (among others) including minimum documentation requirements, the requirements for commercial and financial qualification, satisfaction ratings for internal business units and suppliers/ contractors, and a RASIC matrix (i.e.: Responsible, Accountable, Support, Information, Consulted) for all SEC employees involved in specific procurement- related activities and processes. The e-Bidding system we use is based on an e-commerce concept and has helped to increase transparency along the entire procurement process, enhance data protection and confidentiality, and improve communication between SEC and all suppliers. Two satisfaction indices are tracked by our Contracting Sector to gain insights into important areas throughout the procurement process. Internal business units at SEC receive satisfaction surveys every six months, whereas suppliers and contractors receive a similar survey once every quarter. For 2021, we established a target satisfaction index score of 85% for both groups and proudly, we achieved a satisfaction score of 88% for both groups. 2021 ESG REPORT 66 Facilitating the Transition to a Low Carbon and Circular EconomyEmpowering People and CommunitiesEnabling Responsible Business Practices",

Up until the year 2025, annual localization and local content targets have been established for several business lines. For local suppliers specifically, we aim for 80% of our total procurement spending to be on locally owned suppliers by 2025. From 2017 to 2021, total procurement expenditure on local manufacturers and contractors averaged 85.9% and compared to 2020, this figure increased from 83% to 91%. A key way we support local suppliers and contractors is through our \u2018BENA\u2019 (Build & Employ National Abilities) program. Key goals of this program include: In the past, the BENA program has helped local suppliers and contractors by giving preferences to suppliers that can demonstrate increased local content, assigning up to 10% of each purchase to small and medium-sized (SME) organizations, and working with investors and international companies to attract them to come and work in Saudi Arabia. The next strategic direction for the BENA program is currently (at the time of publishing this report) under review by our Executive Management Committee. Maximization of local content. Transfer of know-how and technologies. Building national expertise in the fields of manufacturing, maintenance, repair and research and development. Development of local manufacturers and contractors.

These structures are occasionally adjusted to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and to incorporate best practices. Our Corporate Governance Code defines a range of key governance policies to be adhered to by our Board of Directors, Board Committees and other key functions and personnel. The key governance policies cover important areas such as the rights of shareholders, election and responsibilities of board members, internal control systems, stakeholders, disclosure, transparency and more. Additional and complementary policies include our Shareholders & General Assembly Rights Charter , as well as the respective charters for our Board of Directors, Board Committees and Executive Committee. An Internal Governance function operates under our Board Secretary to promote awareness and adherence to all corporate governance structures throughout SEC. This function is also involved in submitting various governance-related reports and communicates SEC\u2019s position on regulatory capital markets compliance and emerging governance trends.BOARD OF DIRECTORS Our Board of Directors (\u2018Board\u2019) set the tone for how SEC is managed and maintains the broadest powers throughout our organization after the General Assembly. The Board of Directors Charter defines the Board\u2019s authorities and responsibilities, which include establishing and regularly reviewing corporate policies, developing a corporate strategy, setting and monitoring performance objectives, determining appropriate capital structures, reviewing the effectiveness of internal control systems and making recommendations to the General Assembly. The Board is to comprise nine Board Members, each appointed by the General Assembly for a term not exceeding three years, and is required to meet at least four times per year. The Chairman of the Board, who is appointed by the Board itself, cannot hold any executive position within SEC. Included in the Board Charter is a proposed induction program for all new Board Members. The main areas of this program include an overview of SEC, a description of SEC\u2019s main business lines, field visits to SEC\u2019s facilities (including a Control Center and power plant), and other induction programs related to SEC\u2019s executive management and overall systems. The Board, Board Committees, Board Members and the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) have their performance evaluated annually. Most performance evaluations are overseen by the Chairman of Board with effective participation by our Independent Board Members. The Non-Executive Board Members conduct a performance evaluation on the Chairman of Board. Every three years, an external evaluation on the Board\u2019s performance is conducted by a competent third-party. Throughout 2021, 10 Board meetings were held with an attendance rate over 97%. As of the 31st of December, 2021, our Board comprised nine Board Members in total, of which three were independent and six were non-executive members. The backgrounds and experiences of our Board are relevant and appropriately diverse in order to effectively steer SEC towards the achievement of its strategic objectives. Each Board Member has held highly regarded leadership positions at reputable organizations across a range of industries, including power generation, government, education, law, investment, project management, management consulting, capital markets and finance.

        "content": "2021 ESG REPORT77 Our Economic Progress SEC\u2019s economic performance has continually proven to be robust. Compared to 2020, our total revenues increased by 0.9%, mostly due to growth in sales of electric power, growth in our subscriber base and improved metering efficiencies. There were 428.9 thousand new subscribers in 2021, representing an increase of approximately 11% compared to 2020, which contributed to a 13% increase in revenue from electricity connections. Due to increases in wheeling usage, our revenue from transmissions systems increased by nearly 35%. Other operating revenues decreased by 53%, stemming mostly from a decline in SEC\u2019s balancing account in accordance with the regulatory framework. Net profits increased by nearly 376% compared to 2020. The majority of this increase originates from Saudi Arabia\u2019s financial and regulatory reforms, which included cancelling the government fees required by SEC as of the 1st of January, 2021. In 2020, these fees amounted to approximately SAR 15.7 billion.

        "content": "2022 ESG Report 4At Saudi Electricity Company, we proudly acknowledge our role as a crucial contributor towards the sustainable vision that shapes the future of both our nation and the globe. As we aspire to drive a positive impact on our communities, people, and the environment, our business activities and societal investments are closely aligned to the Saudi Vision 2030 and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. On behalf of the board, it gives me great pleasure to present our latest Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) report for the year 2022, which acts as a testament to our ongoing endeavors to bolster our sustainability performance. ESG holds paramount importance at Saudi Electricity Company, serving as an integral part of our corporate and ESG strategies. Our Climate Action As per the World Bank1, the energy sector is a prime contributor to global GHG emissions, accounting for approximately 40% of the world\u2019s emissions. We, as Saudi Arabia\u2019s leading fully integrated electricity utility company, understand the significant role we must play in addressing the climate crisis. Consequently, with the leadership of the Ministry of Energy and support of the board, we have outlined ambitious plans for the incorporation of renewable energy into the Kingdom\u2019s electrical grid. This strategic move not only aims to reduce our emissions and enhance our environmental sustainability, but also supports Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030 and goal towards economic diversification. Our Saudization At Saudi Electricity Company, our mission is to empower our people and facilitate their effective integration into the workforce, in line with the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030. As a result, we have successfully raised the Saudization rate of our workforce to 93.75% from 93.66% in 2021. Our Governance The Board\u2019s role in upholding exemplary governance practices is an aspect we take very seriously. We firmly believe in the criticality of governance in safeguarding shareholder rights by fostering a culture of sustainability, disclosure and transparency of our stakeholders all underpinned by robust internal controls. This year, one of our main endeavors involved developing and implementing governance structures, including defining roles, responsibilities, and accountabilities to control the implementation of strategic initiatives and projects and ensure targeted outputs are achieved. This year we laid the groundwork for women empowerment by creating a Diversity and Inclusion department and endorsing a diversity and inclusion strategy to increase our female employee statistics as well as the number of women in leadership positions. From myself, all the Board members, our Executive Management team and all our employees I am deeply grateful to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz and His Royal Highness Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for their boundless encouragement and support in making our 2022 achievements a reality. I also extend my gratitude to His Royal Highness Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the Minister of Energy, and Chairman of the Ministerial Committee for his support and for restructuring the Electricity Sector. I take great pride in our 2022 achievements, and I ask Allah to guide us towards attaining even greater sustainability milestones as we work towards fulfilling the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2023 goals.

        "content": "2022 ESG Report 5In 2022, we persistently worked towards the realization of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Vision 2030 and the UN SDGs, while also ensuring excellent customer service and the incorporation state-of-the-art technologies in Saudi Arabia\u2019s electricity sector. Our latest undertakings and accomplishments led to an augmentation of the global and national goals to which we contribute positively, while concurrently upholding our long-standing ambitions and sustainability pledges. We remain unwavering in our quest for the national Net-Zero target by 2060 through our support of the national vision to increase the Kingdom\u2019s productivity and inclusivity. Our 2022 Environmental, Social and Governance report outlines our progress thus far and demonstrates the execution of our aspirations in SEC operations and strategy. Achieving environmental sustainability At The Saudi Electricity Company, the integration of renewable energy with the Saudi National Grid is a key initiative in our environmental sustainability ambitions. Since the plan\u2019s inception, we have made significant strides, remaining on course to complete 25 renewable energy interaction projects by 2026. These projects will have a total capacity of 15.994 GW and have the potential to avoid 33.5 M ton of CO2e emissions annually. As of 2022, we have 13 renewable interconnection projects underway and have committed to and entered into renewable energy offtake agreements. We acknowledge that even though our carbon emissions scope 1 decreased by 6% compared to our 2016 baseline, there remain many opportunities to reduce carbon emissions and align with national targets and the Paris Agreement. To foster eco-friendly business operations, we have initiated the development of a roadmap to initiate circular economy initiatives at the Saudi Electricity Company to optimize the use of the Kingdom\u2019s valuable resources. Furthermore, we certified ISO 14001 in several of our power plants. SEC performance on waste management improved as our combined waste diversion through on-site waste management activities have seen an increase of 68% and off-site waste diversion has increased by 24% as compared to 2021. We are aware that sustainability is a shared endeavor, calling for collective action from all stakeholders. Therefore, we established an ESG department to develop ESG strategy in collaboration with all SEC business units and ensure alignment across our initiatives and progress. We have also established a committee that will review and approve all matters related to ESG. As a result, we completed a comprehensive update of our ESG materiality assessment laying the groundwork for SEC\u2019s ESG strategy aimed to be finalized in 2023. As a testimony to our efforts and approach to ESG, the Company corporate sustainability assessment score issued by Standards & Poor\u2019s (S&P) has improved from 23 to 32 in 2022. Lifting up our community Our relentless dedication to community enrichment reflects our recognition of the importance of fostering our valuable relationship with the communities we serve. We remain steadfast in SEC charitable activities, including valuable Ihsan Care initiative, the employee deduction initiative and several other projects that give back to our community. Eng.

As a testament to our commitment to empowering and training local supply chain, we have also achieved a prominant progress in \u201cBENA\u201d program goals, and executed 417 programs for upgrading employee skills and providing transition assistance. The commitment to our employee development and safety was materialized by 915,000 hours of training delivered in 2022, career development plans for 26,804 employees, zero discrimination incidents, and reduction of our lost time injury by 53%. Women empowerment We believe that diversity and inclusion are not only written values but are also strategic assets that enable us to deliver innovative and sustainable solutions for our customers and society. As a result, we established a dedicated Diversity and Inclusion department and endorsed a strategy enabling us to empower women in a variety of ways. This led to nearly tripling the rate of female employees and to tripling the number of females in leadership roles compared to 2021. We will continue our journey of women empowerment and will strive to make our Company a place where women can thrive, work and achieve their personal ambitions. Digitizing our operations One of our key strategic objectives is to bolster energy efficiency and data tracking by deploying of innovative digital solutions. To date, we have expanded our adoption of digital solutions to ensure accurate tracking of the resources used in generation operations. Our substantial achievements in network automation are reflected by SEC successful installation of approximately 11 million smart meters in 2022, an increase of 0.5 million compared to 2021. We also implemented a range of initiatives, including using cutting-edge drone and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to monitor the transmission lines. Additionally, we launched initiatives designed to develop advanced systems that mitigate power outages and provide optimal services to our valued customers. Moving forward, we aim to improve data quality throughout the business to enhance internal controls and operational efficiency. Finally with modesty and gratitude, it is imperative to highlight all our ESG achievements for 2022 across the company. This success is due primarily to the Heavenly blessings of Allah and the support of our wise leadership as well as the oversight of His Royal Highness the Minister of Energy. I personally would like to thank every employee in the Company as without their dedication and hard work it would have been hard to achieve and implement our ESG ambitions as we strive to become one of the sustainability leaders in the energy sector.

To guarantee we successfully advance towards this goal, we have recognized six strategic objectives:These goals encompass a comprehensive approach to our operations and are designed to elevate our performance and reputation. One of the key drivers is Security of Supply and Reliability: we have implemented four strategic programs to enhance our capabilities in this area: Asset Management, Renewable Integration, System Reliability, and International Interconnections. These programs ensure that we have the necessary resources and infrastructure to consistently deliver reliable and secure services to our customers. At the cornerstone of this is our focus on Safety and Operational Excellence. We focus on two strategic programs to continuously improve our operations: Efficiency Improvement and Health, Safety & Security Transformation. By optimizing our efficiency and prioritizing safety measures, we strive to achieve excellence in all aspects of our work. We are also committed to Environment, Social Responsibility, and Governance. Through five strategic programs, namely Environmental Protection, Liquid Displacement in Generation and Transmission & Distribution, Corporate Social Responsibility, and Governance & Processes Improvement, we actively address environmental concerns, engage with our communities, and uphold strong governance practices. Financial sustainability is vital for our long-term success and to ensure this, we have established four strategic programs: Non-regulated Revenue Growth, OPEX Optimization, Capital Efficiency, and Regulated Revenue Protection. These programs focus on generating sustainable revenue, optimizing operational expenses, efficiently utilizing capital, and safeguarding our regulated revenue streams.

By transforming our customer experience and consistently delivering exceptional service, we aim to build a strong brand image and foster customer loyalty. These comprehensive and targeted initiatives form the foundation of our strategic approach, allowing us to advance toward our goals with confidence and distinction. In 2022, we focused on building up an ESG department, by hiring a dedicated and expertly qualified new head for the department while also developing existing competencies throughout the Company Our newly established ESG department is responsible for leading, implementing and constantly improving our ESG strategy in cooperation with each one of our Company\u2019s business lines. Additionally, the department is responsible for coordinating, initiating, monitoring and following up on all ESG-related activities throughout our Company.. This enables us to ensure that the ESG committee, who oversee the development of ESG initiatives, can effectively deliver on its mandate and responsibilities. The ESG committee also engage leadership on ESG matters. We held multiple ESG committee meetings to foster knowledge sharing among executives, gather feedback, guide decision-making, and actively involve senior leadership. This inclusive approach ensured that all perspectives were considered and facilitated alignment with other strategies, while reinforcing robust governance and accountability at the executive level. These efforts contribute to a cohesive and prosperous future for our ESG initiatives. We prioritize environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) and regard it as a key pillar of our corporate strategy. Part of our ESG strategy reboot is to ensure it includes key transformations across the business and reflects our important focus on ESG. In 2022, we re-evaluated our ESG material topics which guided us to diligently update our ESG strategy based on our business operations and stakeholder expectations. This strategy embodies our commitment to sustainability, responsible business practices, and long-term value creation. We updated our ESG strategy and made sure to collect feedback from all relevant stakeholders to ensure internal alignment and to take into consideration emerging best practices and evolving sustainability standards. By proactively developing and implementing a well-structured and comprehensive ESG strategy, we aim to mitigate potential ESG risks and seize new opportunities in an increasingly ESG-focused business landscape. In the strategy we will outline key pillars of our plan to focus on creating shared value in the topics of climate action, nature and circularity, people and community, and responsible governance. Each pillar has specific strategic objectives and KPIs to guarantee their successful implementation. Overall, our ESG strategy will aim to be transparent, ethical, accountable and responsible while contributing to the Kingdom\u2019s transition to renewable energy to achieve Net-Zero emissions. Our strategic goals, targets, and commitments were derived through benchmarking against a group of peers within the power and utilities industry, further emphasizing identified considerations, while considering different aspirational levels Our aim is to endorse the updated ESG strategy in early 2023 with a target to initiate implementation in the following year.

The Vision 2030 is categorized into three main pillars: a Vibrant Society, A Thriving Economy and an Ambitious Nation. Under the three pillars, 35 specific goals are outlined to demonstrate how our kingdom plans to realize its vision. Through our activities and initiatives, we recognize our potential contribution to 20 of the 35 goals. To support KSA in \u2018developing our cities\u2019 pillar, we are planning to supply the expected surge in electricity demand, due to the mega national projects emanating from the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030, such as the new housing projects undertaken by the Ministry of Municipal, Rural Affairs and Housing. Living by serving pilgrims  is a goal that we embody through all of our practices and activities. That is why we prioritized securing a reliable electric service during Haj Season. As a responsible company, we value giving back to the community by empowering our society and being responsible to society. Therefore, several initiatives have been established and have progressed with promising results in 2022. The Company donated 2 million SAR to our Ihsan Care initiative, a charity established by our Company to allocate funds towards a range of charities around KSA. An additional 5+ million SAR were donated to charities from our internal deduction program offered to employees. Furthermore, we have conducted several social welfare initiatives including a winter clothing initiative, the Breakfast of Our Neighborhood initiative, and a Ramadan Iftar fasting initiative. Achieving environmental sustainability is one of our priority areas which we constantly strive to reach this goal. Among our achievements this year, we implemented best global practices in the field of environmental preservation and ESG enhancement, resulting in a 40% improvement in our 2022 ESG score evaluated by S&P compared to 2021. This figure reflects our efforts to attain environmental sustainability in the provision of electricity. We were also able to reduce our scope 1 carbon emissions by 6% in 2022 compared to 2016. A tailored program for renewable energy integration projects has been crafted to contribute to the realization of the KSA vision 2030 strategic objective of 50% electricity generated by renewable energy. Additionally, our vision to attain a truly sustainable electricity sector is led by the Ministry of Energy strategy and other programs such as the Circular Carbon Economy National Program and the Liquid Displacement Program. We continue to support our citizens in caring for their families  alongside Vision 2030, therefore in 2022, we increased our employee benefits by introducing an educational allowance. We have also improved our valuable employees\u2019 Housing Loan Policy, as we support each Saudi family\u2019s aspiration to own a home. We also contribute to the caring for our health goal, with a series of implementations this year including blood donation campaigns in business areas, a safety tours initiative for charitable associations and institutions, improvements in the employees\u2019 medical insurance policy and ensuring we receive the best advisory on all matters related to occupational health and safety. We believe in building up and educating KSA\u2019s future workforce, which is why the learning for working goal is important to us. We have dedicated programs for every level of employees including senior leadership and early leadership and specialists to ensure continuous learning. In 2022 alone, we have trained and developed our employees to ensure efficient and effective business performance, started working on the Saudi Skills Development Program with suppliers to harness the skills of the Saudi citizens and meet the energy solutions, and ran our Cooperative Training Programs and Tamheer Program, which trained a combined total of 50 male and female graduates. SEC continues to upskill its workforce at all levels for its future plans. Ensuring that we provide equal opportunity  is a key aspect in our day-to-day business, which is why we have introduced new measures to empower women at our Company in 2022. One of our main achievements this year is the significant increase of our rate of female employees and tripling the number of our females in leadership positions. We have several initiatives in place which are aligned with boosting our small business and productive families for Vision 2030 as well as supporting our national companies, SEC has several initiatives and achievements in place. Our Build and Employ National Abilities (BENA) program aims to increase localization and local content in energy products and service, in addition to the previously mentioned Saudi Skills Development Program that aims to strengthen local suppliers. Other initiatives and measures were taken to increase local content from Saudi companies to 40% during 2022 from 18% in 2021. We have also managed to increase the average contribution of local content to 35%, while procurement from national factories rose by more than 71%. In an effort to attract the talent we need, we have implemented an additional bonus for critical talent and positions, as part of our updated employee benefits.

We are also working on projects to connect renewable energy plants; the goal is to connect more than 25 renewable energy projects being developed across the Kingdom, which should go a long way in achieving Vision 2030 and launching our promising sector. Going even further, we aim to increase the competitiveness of our energy sector. We have aligned our strategic investment program to support the Kingdom\u2019s Electricity Sector National Plan, which intends to raise the quality and reliability of service provided to consumers. We have also signed contracts, valued at SAR 44 billion and included several significant strategic agreements that raised the reliability of the electrical system. We own the Integrated Dawiyat Company for Telecom and Information Technology which was established to independently invest and activate the latest fiber-optic network in KSA. Our large-scale smart meter supply and installation is an example of the digital solutions we plan to integrate into the electricity sector to ensure we compete globally. On a smaller scale, we are contributing in part to building a unique regional logistical hub, since we provide logistics services related to facilities and transportation to enable organizational units and employees to work at their best level. We endeavor to support employees in being responsible for their lives. An example of this is our optional saving program offered to employees, a great planning tool that helps employees achieve financial independence. Additionally, we aspire to be responsible in business and participate in beneficial non-profit-seeking activities. In accordance with our goal, we organized and coordinated the hosting of the Saudi Science and Engineering Team, who won 22 awards at the International Science and Engineering Fair 2022 at SEC headquarters in Riyadh. Additionally, we also partake in annual charitable activities and donations. These activities include promoting blood donation campaigns within our Company, a winter clothing initiative, participation in the Fourth Occupational Health and Safety Conference, organizing an internal breast cancer prevention event on World Disease Awareness Day. Our governance is considered in all aspects of our business.

We are also embracing transparency by digitizing real-time data tracking and making it accessible to stakeholders across the business for better transparency, risk management, and compliance.

Reduction of our greenhouse gas emissions: Our most recent carbon emissions reduction is the completion of a fuel extraction research project with General Electric. The aim was to improve the combustion process of crude fuels in gaseous units to obtain lower emissions, improve performance and extend the lives of turbine parts. We have also implemented many initiatives to contribute to the National liquid displacement program, which enables a seamless transition toward greater utilization of natural gas, thereby fostering a reduction in GHG emissions. We have initiated the development of a Company-wide Carbon Management Plan.  It demonstrates our ambition for environmental sustainability, enables our reduction goals, and addresses stakeholders\u2019 increasing demands for responsible business practices. The main driver behind our development of this plan is to combat climate change, minimize environmental impact, and align with global efforts to transition towards a low- carbon economy. Saudi Electricity Company continues to work toward emissions reduction by identifying all sources of carbon emissions. Additionally, we have been working on developing a strategy to activate a circular economy in order to reduce raw material dependence as well as protect our environment by reducing the use of natural resources. As a market leader in generating, transmitting and distributing electricity in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, we hold the potential to have a great impact on reaching zero neutrality. Accordingly, we are in line with  the Kingdom 2030 vision goal of generating 50% of electricity from integrated renewable projects and 50% from natural gas by 2030. As part of our initiatives to ensure the realization of this goal, we have planned a $3bn investment to build 25 renewable interconnection projects, integrating a total capacity of 15,994 megawatts with the potential to avoid 33.5 M ton of CO2e in emissions each year. So far, we have made some progress on the goal, with 13 renewable interconnection projects currently under construction, of which two are already operational.Sustainable Development Goals Alignment",

        "content": "2022 ESG REPORT41 Electrical Distribution Risks We are actively identifying and addressing potential risks associated with providing electrical energy. Our primary focus is on reducing energy losses and improving the customer experience through various projects and initiatives aimed at enhancing energy efficiency and customer satisfaction. We are committed to adopting an approach that aligns with international best practices. Financial risks We face different types of financial risks, such as foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity price risks, as well as credit and liquidity risks, which could affect our financial performance. To mitigate these risks, we have implemented a comprehensive risk management program, which includes the use of derivative financial instruments. These measures aim to reduce any potential adverse effects on our financial performance. Market Risk Market risk arises when the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument are affected by fluctuations in market prices. This type of risk can be categorized into three main categories: foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, and other price risks. These risks are caused by changes in market conditions and can impact the value of financial instruments. Foreign Exchange Risks Foreign exchange risks occur when a Company\u2019s commercial transactions, recognized assets, or liabilities are denominated in a currency other than its own. These risks are associated with fluctuations in the value of the foreign currency in relation to the Company\u2019s currency. In our case, since our currency is the Saudi Arabian Riyal, which is fixed to the US Dollar at an exchange rate of SAR 3.75 per Dollar, most of our foreign currency transactions are in US Dollars, eliminating our exposure to foreign exchange risks. Interest Rate Risks Interest rate risks refer to the potential impact on the fair rate or future cash flows of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in the interest rate market. Our exposure to interest rate risk mainly comes from loans issued at variable rates, which can lead to changes in cash flows due to changes in interest rates. To hedge against interest rate risks, we use interest rate swaps, which are classified as derivative financial liabilities in the financial position list. In addition to interest rate risks, we may also use hedging instruments, such as derivatives, to manage foreign exchange risks. When establishing a hedging relationship, we document the relationship between the hedging instrument and our hedge line, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy for various hedging operations. We continuously monitor the effectiveness of our hedging relationships, and if they do not meet the requirements, we may adjust the hedging ratio to qualify for hedging controls again.Credit Risk Credit risks arise from our cash and cash equivalents, deposits in banks and financial institutions, and credit exposure from sales-based debits. We assess the credit quality of our customers by taking into account past experiences and other relevant factors. Credit risk refers to the possibility of incurring financial losses if a client or other party fails to fulfill its contractual obligations to a financial instrument, primarily from our receivables from clients. We settle our sales using cash, our payment service \u201cSADAD,\u201d or major credit cards. We use a general model to estimate expected credit losses for government, parastatals, and financial assets. Expected credit losses over a 12-month period and over the instrument\u2019s lifetime are calculated based on the associated change in credit risk. We believe that we can collect non-governmental debts by stopping services to those who are in arrears and by following up with them legally with the appropriate authorities. Liquidity Risk We may encounter liquidity risks when we face difficulty in obtaining the necessary funds to fulfill our obligations related to financial instruments. To manage these risks, our goal is to ensure that we have enough funding facilities to meet our current and future obligations. We have achieved this objective by maintaining adequate financing flexibility through appropriate credit facilities in various financing formats. We expect to meet our future financial obligations through cash flows from our operations, which are primarily generated by cash receipts from receivables and external financing.Compliance and Risk Management 2022 ESG REPORT",

To mitigate these risks, we have implemented a compliance management system, which includes monitoring external regulations and legislation and maintaining compliance records to ensure adherence to regulations and avoid any potential risks of non-compliance. We also regularly evaluate our level of compliance with these regulations and legislation to ensure ongoing compliance. Technology and Information Security Risks We recognize the high risk of cyberattacks in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, one of the often-targeted countries. Given the sensitivity of our infrastructure, we are committed to enhancing cybersecurity measures to minimize the risk of cyberattacks. We employ the latest security technology that adheres to international standards and have established several cybersecurity control centers that operate 24/7 to respond to cyber incidents, protect our assets and data, and ensure compliance with cybersecurity controls, frameworks, and standards set by the legislative authorities in the Kingdom. Our cybersecurity sector has achieved excellence in compliance with the basic cybersecurity controls issued by the National Cybersecurity Authority.Human Competencies Risks Employee engagement and organizational health are widely recognized as having a significant impact on organizational performance. The Employee engagement score improved from 6.5 to 6.8 in the previous period, and this year, we have made great efforts to increase participation in the Employee Engagement Survey, achieving a record high of 89%. In 2023, we plan to align career engagement with our cultural transformation initiatives and launch initiatives to improve the six factors that received the lowest ratings in the latest survey results. We have developed Company-wide action plans and appointed specialized teams from the Human Resources Activity to implement them. The Human Resources Business Partner team will support business leaders and teams in ensuring alignment with human resources initiatives to improve Employee engagement. Compensation and employee benefits are essential components of human capital management that demonstrate our ability to attract and retain talent. In 2022, we have made significant improvements to the employee compensation and benefits structure to enhance its competitiveness in the local market. These improvements included the implementation of a new pay scale, improvements in transportation allowance, the introduction of the children\u2019s education allowance, improvements in the employees\u2019 medical insurance policy, improvements in the employees\u2019 housing loan policy, and an additional bonus for critical talent and positions. Additionally, by reviewing fresh graduates\u2019 salaries, we have attracted outstanding young Saudi graduates, ensuring a thriving supply of local talent. Supply Chain Risks We have been exposed to repercussions since the start of 2022 due to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict crisis. This crisis caused disruptions in global supply chains, resulting in increased prices and shipping costs. Despite these challenges, we have managed to maintain supply stability by strengthening our logistics system. We have achieved this by diversifying sources of supply and focusing on alternative local sources of suppliers and manufacturers to enhance the local content of purchases. Safety and Loss Prevention Risks We are committed to complying with the requirements of regulatory bodies, including government agencies and national and international laws and standards. We apply best practices in safety and loss prevention to protect our employees, assets, and contractors. We adopted a strategic transformation plan to improve safety performance across power generation, transmission, and distribution to customers. We have engaged the services of leading consulting firms to measure performance, identify gaps, and propose practical plans for development. The development plan promotes a safety culture and an integrated safety management system that includes security, health, and process protection. The new safety management system ensures continuous monitoring, evaluation, and improvement, which are essential for safe operational excellence and compliance. Compliance and Risk Management",

To achieve this goal, we have unified our specifications and standards, procurement and contracting processes, and financial and technical qualifications, applying international best practices. We are  actively improving our material inventory and asset management practices, as well as the follow- up management of portfolios and capital projects, to increase performance efficiency. Through research and development activities, we encourage innovation and institutional excellence by leveraging in-house expertise to upskill our employees and utilizing innovation incubators. In 2022, we achieved our goal of reducing inventory stock value by SAR 43 million compared to 2021, maintaining an availability rate of 96.27% in warehouses. We manage 4.5 million registered warehouse movements across the Kingdom. More than 1,000 contracts were signed in 2022, valued at SAR 44 billion, and including significant strategic agreements that raised the reliability of the electrical system, such as NEOM, Diriyah Gate, the Ministry of Housing, and smart meter supply and installation. We have achieved savings of over SAR 287 million through negotiations and the application of a single-package system for similar projects. Despite challenges and disruption facing supply chains globally which contributed to increased prices and shipping costs, we have maintained the stability of supplies. We are working to strengthen the logistics system, diversifying sources of supply and focusing on alternative local sources of suppliers and manufacturers to enhance the local content of purchases. We are committed to responsible supplier selection and prioritizing local suppliers in our business partnerships. We value mutually rewarding and compliant alliances with suppliers that adhere to all relevant laws and regulations. Following our Code of Conduct & Ethics, we only conduct business with suppliers and contractors that comply with local and international laws and regulations, as well as any additional standards defined by SEC relating to Labour, health, safety, and environment, or as deemed necessary. Each supplier and contractor are required to acknowledge and commit to abide by the provisions stated in our Code of Conduct & Ethics. To promote fair and competitive opportunities for our suppliers and contractors, we have established a procedure for registering and qualifying suppliers, as well as an e-Bidding system. The procedure covers various key areas, such as minimum documentation requirements, commercial and financial qualification requirements, and a RASIC (Responsible, Accountable, Support, Informed, Consulted) matrix for employees involved in procurement-related activities and processes. The e-Bidding system is based on an e-commerce concept, providing increased transparency, data protection, confidentiality, and improved communication between us and suppliers. We have made it a strategic priority to support local suppliers and contractors, with establishing localization targets for our several business lines. Specifically, we aim to have 75% of our total procurement spending allocated to locally owned suppliers by 2030. In the smart grid project, we are achieving a localization rate of 75%. Additionally, more than six new factories were added to the qualified local factories in smart ring interconnection units, enabling an annual production capacity of over 50,000 units. Furthermore, the number of local-approved factories supplying us with materials increased to over 700. Total contracts and purchases amounted to more than SAR 60 billion, with an average local content contribution of 35%. Procurement from national factories also rose by over 71%. Suppliers Audit We conduct regular supplier audits to measure and assess our suppliers performance. These audits serve a crucial purpose: to ensure that our suppliers are operating efficiently and reliably, while also complying with all local and international laws and regulations, as well as our own supplier code of conduct. Through these audits, we can identify areas where our suppliers can improve their performance, and work with them to implement changes that will reduce negative impacts and enhance their operations. We believe that by doing this, we can build stronger, more sustainable relationships with our suppliers, which ultimately benefits both parties.Availability and Reliability of Supply Supply Chain 2020 2021 2022 Supplier Audit Description Supplier Audit Number of suppliers that are subject to audit3,599 4,542 2,897 Number of suppliers identified as having significant actual and potential negative impacts510 700 730 Number of suppliers with which improvements were agreed upon as a result of audit700 720 750",

The BENA program has already proven beneficial to local suppliers and contractors through various initiatives, such as giving preference to suppliers that can demonstrate increased local content, assigning up to 10% of each purchase to small and medium-sized organizations, and collaborating with investors and international companies to attract them to work in Saudi Arabia. These efforts serve to enhance the capabilities of local manufacturers and companies, creating more job opportunities for national talents and contributing to the growth of the Saudi economy. To comply with the Council of Ministers\u2019 Resolution No. 658, which enforces local content regulations and requirements for enterprises in which the state or the Public Investment Fund holds a stake of more than 50%, we have implemented a variety of initiatives and capabilities. These efforts have effectively established a flexible supply chain in Saudi Arabia, complemented by a comprehensive workforce development scheme. In 2022, SEC had a 71% ratio of purchase from local factories, up from 68.1% in 2021. This achievement was made possible by the establishment of a flexible supply chain in the Kingdom.

Additionally, we will be supporting local suppliers in meeting their ESG standards. To enhance supply chain sustainability, we will prioritize ESG factors when selecting suppliers and ensure they comply with ESG standards. This approach will help us to promote responsible business practices and contribute to the overall sustainability of the supply chain. Furthermore, by providing resources and guidance to local suppliers, we believe they can improve their ESG performance and become more competitive in the global market. Our Data Privacy Policy governs the collection, storage, protection, and authorization of all data in accordance with relevant regulations. The policy is based on ten principles, including accountability, access to data, transparency, data disclosure limitation, choice and consent, data security, limiting data collection, use, retention, and destruction, data quality, and monitoring and compliance. Multiple policies have been established to support our data privacy goals, including the Cybersecurity Policy, Data Classification Policy, Data Management Policies, Data Retention Policy, Data Sharing Policy, and Data Collection Policy. The rapid development of technology and information security poses significant risks that we must address to protect our assets and data. We recognize the sensitivity of our infrastructure and the high likelihood of cyberattacks. To mitigate the risk of cyberattacks, we implemented the latest security technologies that comply with international standards and established several cybersecurity control centers that operate around-the- clock to respond to cyber incidents. To effectively manage our cybersecurity practices, we have established a standalone Cybersecurity Function that reports directly to the CEO as well as a Data Management and Governance Office. These measures demonstrate our commitment to addressing cybersecurity risks seriously. The Data Management and Governance Office was established in response to a requirement from the Saudi Data and Artificial Intelligence Authority (SDAIA), which drives Saudi Arabia\u2019s data and AI agenda to achieve Vision 2030 goals. By the end of 2024, all entities in Saudi Arabia must comply with SDAIA\u2019s regulations and those issued by the National Cybersecurity Authority. To prepare for future regulatory requirements and improve compliance levels, we have established a data management strategy that includes conducting gap assessments on existing data governance, developing a plan to meet the data governance requirements from the National Data Management Office (NDMO), developing, implementing, and monitoring a Data Governance Framework, and reviewing, enhancing, and implementing all existing data policies. We have implemented several measures to address our data privacy needs, including ISO certifications, risk assessments, continuous monitoring systems, awareness-raising activities, and regular internal audits of our information security and data privacy practices. We conduct Operational Technology (OT) Risk Assessments on regular basis to assess the appropriateness of established mitigation measures, and a Security Operation Center continuously monitors both Information Technology and OT systems. Our awareness-raising practices for information security and data privacy aim to help employees understand their role in reducing data breaches. All employees involved in data processing operations must sign a non- disclosure and confidentiality undertaking.

        "content": "2022 ESG Report 80To ensure responsible waste management, we have a waste disposal contract until 2024, which includes new regulations issued by the National Center of Waste Management (MWAN). Waste Diverted from Disposal In 2022, our efforts to divert various types of waste from disposal have been successful, with significant increases in our diversion rates. Specifically, our carbon ash waste diversion from disposal increased by 17% year on year, while the diversion of oils mixed with water increased by 20% in the same period. These achievements are all part of our ongoing commitment to embrace a circular economy model, where waste is viewed as a valuable resource that can be reused and repurposed, rather than simply discarded. To this end, we have been actively working to increase the usage of waste across our operations. In 2022, we have prepared 32,000 tons of hazardous waste and 15,661 tons of non-hazardous waste for recycling. Further to our commitments, we have prepared 15,000 tons of hazardous waste and 8,930 tons of non-hazardous waste for reuse. Combined, our waste diversion through on-site waste management activities have seen an increase of 68% and off-site waste diversion has increased by 24% as compared to 2021.Waste Management We recognize that waste management is an ongoing challenge, and we are committed to continuing to improve our waste management practices. By setting ambitious targets, implementing innovative solutions, and complying with regulations, we are working towards a more sustainable and responsible future. In our continuous efforts in 2022 to enhance our waste management performance, we have implemented new functions such as the Climate Change & Circular Economy Divisions. These functions aim to promote a circular economy and facilitate the recycling and reuse of materials. According to the National Center of Waste Management (MWAN) Regulation, we reviewed our procedures to be aligned with the new waste management law approved by royal decree on 13 August 2021, which supports transitioning into circular economy business model and saving our natural resources. We have developed a Waste Management Procedure to regulate the handling of all waste produced at our sites. This procedure outlines waste management plans, including the appropriate handling and storage of waste materials. One of our key strategies is procuring materials with minimal negative environmental impacts and prioritizing eco- friendly products where possible. A new procedure has been implemented for material disposal requests which requires accurate quantity measurements and contributes to responsible waste disposal practices. To monitor and mitigate the risks associated with waste management practices, we have implemented an environmental monitoring program for all sites that store waste. This program includes monitoring groundwater and air quality. We have also implemented several measures throughout our operations, such as developing programs to reduce spills and leakages, using less harmful alternatives to ecologically damaging insecticides, replacing power transformers with carcinogenic oils, using qualified contractors to remove petroleum and oil residues, replacing oils in electrical switches with SF6, collaborating with research centers to develop solutions for carbon ash, using XLPE cables instead of oily cables, and implementing sewage collection systems at 53 sites to prevent soil contamination. Carbon ash, also known as fly ash, is the primary type of hazardous waste generated by our operations, along with other hazardous waste such as waste oil and various chemicals. Electrostatic precipitators collect and temporarily store carbon ash in silos, whereas specialized waste contractors collect and process other hazardous waste. To mitigate the negative environmental impact of carbon ash, we are researching ways to transport and use this material safely. We are collaborating with Memorial University of Canada and other research centers to study the separation of valuable metals from carbon ash, such as vanadium, nickel, or active carbon, and exploring applications for water purification and treating gas emissions from boilers. Additionally, we have partnered with Al-Safwa Cement to use carbon ash as an alternative fuel in their production processes, resulting in cost savings of SAR 47 million per year in disposal costs, a 20% reduction in energy consumption, and the transport of over 200,000 cubic meters of carbon ash. Qualified waste contractors appropriately collect and dispose of all non-hazardous waste, such as municipal waste. We have established at least 16 waste management areas that comply with environmental standards to handle hazardous waste safely. Authorized and designated personnel handle all municipal waste, which is segregated and stored in suitable containers.

Water Management Water management is a crucial aspect of our sustainability strategy, and we recognize the importance of responsible water usage in our operations. The water we consume is mainly used for operating steam-run power plants, cooling turbines, cleaning units, and boilers. Most of the seawater we consume is untreated, except for the chlorine we add to prevent algae and microorganism growth. Desalinated water is used for a range of operational activities. We also import and consume treated sewage water in electricity generation in some of our Power Plants and admin buildings. To ensure compliance with the Ministry of Environment, Agriculture, and Water MEWA regulations, we have implemented various measures to monitor and manage our water usage. However, we recognize that more needs to be done, and we have set a future target to develop an operational policy for water management. This policy will ensure that we secure and rationalize water for power plants, and through the circular economy policy, we will set targets for water discharge. We aim to reduce water consumption and wastewater/water discharge, as well as recycle water. We will implement programs to rationalize water in purchased water and waste.In addition to our efforts to reduce water consumption and discharge, we are committed to monitoring our water usage to ensure we do not have negative impacts on the environment. We conduct water pollution impact studies, monitor the discharge water, and conduct marine surveys of the coastal environment of the steam stations. These measures enable us to identify areas where we can improve water usage and minimize environmental impact. Water is treated through desalination units to ensure operational water supply, in addition to establishing agreements for the supply of water with stakeholders such as the National Water Company in the water transmission lines to the Company\u2019s reservoirs. Water discharge is regulated by multiple national and international bodies that set minimum standards to be followed such as the executive regulations of the National Center for Environmental Compliance NCEC and the International Finance Corporation IFC guidelines. To further demonstrate our commitment to protecting the Kingdom\u2019s resources, we have begun importing, treating and consuming sewage water in our PP10 and PP12 generation power plants based in Riyadh. These power plants have been specially designed to accept other types of water and have facilitated an increase in the availability of energy production in combined cycle units, which were previously limited to coastal regions. The year 2022 witnessed an increase in water consumption which was due to increased power generation to meet the rising energy demand in the kingdom.

        "content": "2022 ESG Report 82Water Discharge We are committed to ensuring that all water discharged from our operations complies with local regulatory requirements. To meet the requirements outlined by the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture, we implement several measures to ensure the quality of the water we discharge. Our seawater discharge undergoes regular sampling and monitoring, while our desalinated water is pH regulated and discharged with cooling or rainwater. Water used for cleaning units and boilers, which may contain chemicals such as soda and sodium sulfate, is collected and stored in evaporation ponds. In the event of water contamination with oils and/or fuels, we use a separator unit or oil separator units to recover the oil, which we then use as fuel. We do not discharge any sewage water, which is either treated in a power plant\u2019s sewage treatment station or transported to a central treatment facility. By implementing these measures, we ensure that the water discharged from our operations meets all regulatory requirements. Our commitment to responsible water management is an essential part of our efforts to reduce our environmental impact and contribute to a more sustainable future for all. Preserving biodiversity is a critical part of our commitment to environmental sustainability, and we have implemented various initiatives to achieve this goal. The Environmental Protection Department has set a strategy that focuses on cooperating with local and global partnerships to achieve environmental sustainability. The main objective is to become an Environment & Sustainability Knowledge, Awareness, and Social Responsibility Leader, with multiple programs focusing on plantation and biodiversity. To safeguard Biodiversity, we undertake rigorous measures such as conducting Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) studies and securing NCEC environmental permits in collaboration with National Center for Vegetation Cover (NCVC) and National Center for Wildlife (NCW) for construction projects. These procedures are essential to evaluate the potential environmental impact of our activities and to ensure that we comply with all relevant regulations and guidelines. By adopting such practices, we strive to minimize our impact on the natural world and protect the rich biodiversity of the areas where we operate. Our objective is to continuously safeguard the environment and preserve biodiversity by implementing efficient operations that minimize resource usage, waste generation, and mitigate risks related to biodiversity. To achieve this goal, we have developed a set of initiatives that we aim to pursue continuously. Our biodiversity policies include EMS ISO 14001:2015 procedures such as \u201cEP08 Operational Planning and Control\u201d and \u201cEP06 Site Decommissioning & Rehabilitation Procedure.\u201d These policies enable us to manage our operations to minimize our impact on biodiversity and ensure responsible environmental management. We have also implemented numerous projects to preserve biodiversity, such as the installation of insulators on electric overhead lines to protect birds, and the implementation of an innovative project that preserves the marine environment through the cultivation of coral reefs. Biodiversity We are proud of one of the initiatives supporting the protection of the vegetation cover, in which the largest perennial tree \u201cSarah, Marw\u201d was rescued and protected in one of the sites, which was in Al-Muzahimiyah Governorate (in the village of Al-Haniyah) in the Riyadh region, with an estimated age of more than 100 years. This comes out of our keenness to be a pioneer in preserving the environment, as this initiative aims to protect the tree by covering its visible veins and placing a basin to protect it from the surrounding factors that may affect it to contribute to the protection of the vegetation cover in cooperation with the National Center for Vegetation Cover and Combating Desertification. The Way Forward We plan to close any gaps in our Environmental Policy and broaden the scope and coverage of our ISO14001 certification. Additionally, we will capture baseline environmental performance data related to water usage and waste generation. We will launch a \u201ccircular economy\u201d program, which includes awareness campaigns, to set a long-term goal of zero waste and promote the efficient use of resources. Moreover, we will demonstrate our commitment to reducing water and waste by showcasing our progress in these areas. Furthermore, we will evaluate risks related to water and waste to identify areas where we can improve our operations. Additionally, we plan to assess our land use and biodiversity risks to ensure that our operations do not adversely impact the environment. We are committed to protecting the environment and preserving biodiversity. We will strive to continuously improve our operations and minimize their impact on the environment, contributing to a more sustainable future by implementing these initiatives.",

        "content": "2022 ESG Report 91In 2022, we delivered a total of 417 programs aimed at upgrading employee skills and providing transition assistance. Each employee has a number of cascaded/assigned objectives and KPIs, along with other components that are reviewed every quarter. Several calibration sessions are conducted by the end of the year to determine the final appraisal of each employee, ensuring that our workforce remains engaged, motivated, and focused on achieving our organizational goals. Training and Development for Executive Leadership We recognize that strong executive leadership is essential to the success of our business. To this end, we have implemented a comprehensive training and development program aimed at developing our leadership and talent populations. We have identified approximately 500 individuals in six different talent programs. Each talent program is approximately six months long and includes a blended approach to applied learning, ensuring that participants have the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in leadership roles. Our talent programs are designed to identify and develop the potential of our employees, providing them with the tools and resources they need to succeed in future leadership positions. In addition to our talent programs, we offer \u2018leadership essentials\u2019 programs that are mandatory for all of our top 1,000 leaders each year.

To this end, we have developed an intensive and detailed approach to succession planning that includes pipelines for all of our L1, L2, L3, and L4 positions, which total more than 1,000 positions. We rely on a job-leveling system for adding to the replacement tables. The addition to the readiness 1 & 2 is accepted if there is a maximum one difference level between the candidate\u2019s level and the position level. The addition to the readiness 3 is accepted if there is a maximum two difference level between the candidate\u2019s level and the position level. For each position in our succession planning pipeline, we have three main categories of candidates: R1 (ready now), R2 (Less than 2 Years), R3 (2 Years up to 5 Years), and secondary category R4 (The same Job level). To determine which candidates qualify for each category, we use a set of criteria, ensuring that only the most qualified and capable employees are included in our succession planning pipelines.SVP , EVP , CEO SubsidiaryED, VP Subsidiary, ED SubsidiaryDepartment ManagerDivision ManagerSection Head or equivalent JobUnit Head or equivalent JobCareer Development Reviews We place strong emphasis on employee performance and career development. To this end, we conduct an annual performance and career development review for all employees. This process is designed to identify our overall training and development needs, and it includes several key components. First, we engage in annual performance planning, which involves setting objectives and KPIs for each employee. This helps to ensure that employees are aligned with our organizational goals and are focused on achieving their targets. Second, we conduct regular performance reviews between employees and their line managers. This allows us to provide ongoing feedback and support to employees, ensuring that they have the resources they need to succeed in their roles. Finally, we conduct an annual performance evaluation, which provides a comprehensive overview of an employee\u2019s performance and career development progress over the course of the year. In 2022, we proudly report that 83% of our employees received career development reviews. We believe that this process is essential to supporting the ongoing growth and development of our workforce, and we remain committed to investing in our employees\u2019 success. The Career Development plans have been developed 100% for all employees. The below-mentioned percentages represent the implementation of the same. It has been a significant progress over the last couple years. The reason why it is not 100% is due to the fact that some employees are not attending the scheduled training programs due to unavoidable work commitments.Human Capital Percentage of Total Employees who Received a Career Development Broken down by Level and Gender Managers employees Male employeesLevel GenderNon-managers employees Female employees 2021 74% 90% 74%72% 67%2022 83% 89% 83%81% 70%Percentage of total employees who received a career development Description Performance Reviews Management employees Male employeesLevel GenderNon-management employees Female employees 2020 1,891 33,49131,708 1082021 2,012 32,52730,643 1282022 2,276 31,89329,947 330 L1L2L3L4L5L6",

        "content": "2022 ESG Report 93We also make sure to have at least four candidates on each pipeline to ensure that we have a deep bench of talent to draw from when needed. Those pipelines updated through ongoing talent sessions with all of our leaders throughout the year to manage the pipelines and candidates. This ensures that everyone is aware of the talent we have available and can make informed decisions when it comes to filling leadership positions. In addition, we have developed our own customized software, to manage the entire succession planning process, which tracks the progress of each candidate through the pipeline and ensures that we have a clear understanding of where each candidate stands in terms of their readiness to assume a leadership role. Parental Leave We believe that supporting the needs of our employees and their families is essential to building a strong and engaged workforce. To this end, we offer a comprehensive parental leave policy for female employees. Under our policy, female employees are entitled to a fully paid maternity leave for a period of ten weeks, which can be distributed as they wish. This leave start period can be availed up to four weeks prior to the expected delivery date, as confirmed by an approved medical certificate from a medical utility. During the period of six weeks following delivery, females are mandated to take their leave as they are strictly forbidden to work during that period. Furthermore, our male employees are entitled to a paternity leave. In addition, female employees have the right to extend their leave for an additional period of one month without pay. This allows them to take additional time to care for their newborn child and adjust to the demands of parenthood. We also recognize that some children may require additional care and attention due to medical conditions; for female employees who give birth to a sick or disabled child requiring continuous companionship, we offer a fully paid leave of one month duration, starting from the end of the delivery leave period. This leave can be extended for an additional month without pay as needed. In 2022, seven of our employees enjoyed their right to parental leave. Offering a comprehensive parental leave policy is essential to supporting the needs of our employees and their families, and we remain committed to providing our employees with the support and resources they need to succeed both at work and at home.Benefit Plan Obligations and Retirement Plans for Employees We recognize the importance of providing retirement plans for our employees to ensure their financial security in the future. To this end, we have implemented a comprehensive retirement plan that includes end of service benefits and a savings plan program. The end-of-service benefit is applicable to both Nationals and Non- Nationals as per the Saudi Labour law. However, the Savings plan is limited to Saudi Nationals only. To ensure that our end-of-service benefits are appropriately funded, we conduct an actuarial valuation using the projected unit credit method for liability as of 31 December 2022 and 31 December 2021. This allows us to ensure that our employees\u2019 end of service benefits is fully funded and that they will be able to rely on these benefits when the time comes. In accordance with Article 145 of the Labour Law and the Board of Directors\u2019 meeting held on 2 March 2008, we have implemented a Savings Plan Program to encourage Saudi employees to save and invest in areas that are more beneficial to them to secure their future. Participation in this program is optional for employees, but those who wish to contribute can do so by contributing a monthly minimum of 1% to a maximum of 10% of their basic salary. The rate of return is determined according to the Company\u2019s policy. In addition to our retirement plans, we are committed to improving the productivity of our human resources by increasing employees\u2019 efficiency through the Company\u2019s endeavor to improve human resource productivity, raise the level of employee efficiency, and reduce the total costs of HR. This will have a positive impact on the Company\u2019s performance in the future. The Company\u2019s board of directors approved human resources productivity on 29 June 2022, and it was implemented during the third quarter of 2022. The program entitles eligible Saudi employees to obtain early retirement benefits based on the progress in achieving operational saving targets and will continue until 2025. Employees who participate in the mentioned programs are entitled to benefits.

        "content": "2022 ESG Report 94Employee Engagement We place a high value on employee engagement and satisfaction. To measure our progress in this area, we have been conducting an employee engagement survey twice a year for the past four years. We are pleased to report that we have been making steady improvements in overall employee engagement, with 89% of all employees who answered the survey reporting high levels of engagement in 2022. To ensure that we are continuously improving, we develop an action plan every six months to address the weakest of the 14 best-in-class engagement drivers. By focusing our efforts on the areas that need the most improvement, we are able to make meaningful changes that have a positive impact on our employees. We are also proud to report that our employee satisfaction score has improved from 6.5 in 2021 to 6.8 in 2022, bringing us one step closer to our target of 7. This improvement is a testament to our commitment to creating a positive and engaging work environment for our employees. Furthermore, we have been able to maintain a constant employee absentee rate of 0.21% for the past three years. While this is a great achievement, we are not content with resting on our laurels. We are determined to continue to improve and aim to reach an absentee rate of 0.19% in the near future. By listening to our employees\u2019 feedback and taking action to address their concerns, we are able to create a culture of engagement and mutual respect that benefits both our employees and our organization as a whole. Saudization We are committed to supporting our government\u2019s vision of Saudization by increasing the number of locals in our workforce. We have implemented multiple initiatives to achieve this goal and are proud to report that we achieved the highest Saudization rate in our Company\u2019s history, reaching 93.75% in 2022. To support the development of local nationals, we have designed most of our training and development programs to be inherently suitable for them. For recent Saudi Arabian university graduates, we offer two types of programs: a two-year development program to assist in the development of professional and administrative competencies, and a qualification and training program for graduates of technical colleges, secondary schools, or industrial high schools.Human Capital Employee satisfaction score Employee absentee %2021 2020 6.5 6.1 0.21 0.212022 Targets 6.8 7.0 0.21 0.19To help local nationals learn and develop skills for specialized functions, such as the management of electrical systems or understanding new technological developments for our industry, we offer a Saudi Expertise Development Program. We also provide short-term development courses, on-the-job training, e-learning, and a cooperative trainer program, which aims to improve the experience of employees in technical and administrative areas. We are committed to implementing the guidelines and policies of the Ministry of Human Resources Development & Ministry of Interior pertaining to jobs within the businesses of HSSE, Legal, Accountant, IT, Engineering & Technician. To support employment opportunities for local nationals, we coordinate with the Human Resources Development Fund to employ citizens and obtain necessary support. We also take advantage of the Tamheer program for graduates, which is supported by the Human Resources Development Fund. Furthermore, we communicate and coordinate with universities to train male and female students through cooperative and summer training programs. We believe that investing in the development of our local workforce is essential to building a strong local economy. Human Rights We hold a strong commitment to upholding human rights in all aspects of our operations and with all internal and external stakeholders. Respecting human rights is an integral pillar of our business, and we have defined clear guidelines in our Code of Conduct & Ethics to ensure that we adhere to the highest standards of ethical behavior. We recognize and respect all human rights, locally and internationally and we have defined two broad categories of human rights, specifically those associated with civil rights, such as the right to life and equality, and those associated with economic, social, and cultural rights, such as the right to food. We prohibit all forms of human rights violations associated with race, religion, gender, national origin, disability, or age. We also prohibit child labor, forced labor, abuse, and harassment, including power harassment by superiors. We believe that all employees and stakeholders should be treated with dignity and respect, and we do not tolerate any behavior that goes against this principle. To ensure that we uphold our commitment to human rights, we have implemented robust training programs for all employees and stakeholders. We believe that education and awareness are essential to creating a culture of respect and inclusion, and we are committed to providing ongoing training and support to all employees and stakeholders.",

As part of the hiring and onboarding process, all new hires are required to read and sign the SEC Code of Conduct. We have also established a new department in 2022 for Diversity & Inclusion as part of our commitment towards our code of conduct values. We have an equal opportunity policy that ensures we do not discriminate when hiring. We recruit the most qualified candidates by conducting interviews through a committee in which several different parties participate. All participants sign disclosure forms and fill out candidate evaluation forms to ensure objectivity. We also have policies in place to guarantee equal opportunities among all employees and apply them consistently. We are proud to be an equal opportunity employer and are keen to attract, empower, and integrate women into the work environment. We do not differentiate between salaries of male vs. female employees at SEC, and we are committed to providing a fair and equitable workplace for all our employees. Furthermore, in line with our non-discrimination policies, we have adopted a new program specifically designed to support the rights of the deaf community. This program is part of our new HR Business Line strategy, which is derived from our overall SEC strategy and is in line with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia Vision 2030. The new program aims to qualify our front-line employees to use Saudi Sign Language (SSL) with deaf customers. We recognize that being able to communicate effectively with our customers is essential to providing high- quality service, and we believe that this program will enable us to better serve our deaf customers and promote inclusion in the workplace. Our goal is to ensure that each Customer Service Office has at least one employee who is proficient in SSL. In the future, we plan to expand the program to include more of our front-line employees, so that we can provide even better service to the deaf community. We are pleased to report that there were no incidents of discrimination or harassment at the Company in 2022. By creating a diverse and inclusive work environment, we can attract and retain the best talent, enhance our reputation, and drive long-term success for our organization. Diversity and Inclusion Key achievements We have made significant strides in promoting gender diversity and inclusivity in our workforce. We have created a Diversity and Inclusion Department that oversees D&I initiatives in the Company. The percentage of female new hires increased by more than 77%, indicating our commitment to hiring more women. Additionally, 23 females participated in a talent management pool program called \u201cThe Young Professional Talent\u201d program, setting a new record for our Company. Furthermore, we use an Engagement Scorecard as a measuring tool to measure how committed the employees are to helping the organization succeed, in which female employees Diversity and Equal Opportunity score 8/10 in the engagement score. The growth rate of females in the SEC was also noteworthy, with an increase of 133% between 2021 and 2022. This growth rate highlights our efforts to promote gender diversity at all levels. Our commitment to diversity and inclusivity is further demonstrated by the increasing number of females in our workforce. Currently, there are 333 females employed by the Company. Moreover, we have a total of 2,056 expats in our workforce, bringing in a diverse range of perspectives and experiences. At SEC, we also employ 17,267 individuals below the age of 35 years old amongst our workforce. We have taken several steps to promote gender diversity and inclusivity in the workplace. In addition to the young talent program previously mentioned, a women\u2019s break zone has also been opened for prayer and breaks at the Riyadh headquarters, providing a dedicated space for female employees to take a break and relax. This year, we have also established a nursery for mothers working at our Company, to foster career growth for all employees.

We aim to actively contribute to the diversification of the Saudi economy by emphasizing on Goal 8 of the UN SDGs (Decent Work and Economic Growth). We endeavor to consistently create work opportunities, develop skills, and foster entrepreneurship, all of which are essential for achieving the national vision of a thriving and diversified economy. Additionally, through our focus on Goal 9 (Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure), we actively promote innovation and infrastructure development by supporting initiatives that foster innovation, technology adoption, and sustainable infrastructure, thus contributing to the growth and modernization of key sectors in line with Saudi Arabia\u2019s vision. Our commitment to both these goals also contributes to Vision 2030\u2019s goal of social development; through our initiatives, we empower individuals and communities, enhance their livelihoods, and create a more inclusive society. Veteran Tree Initiative: At Saudi Electricity Company, we are profoundly committed to biodiversity and environmental preservation as a cornerstone of our strategy, believing that the health of our ecosystems is inherently linked to the wellbeing of the communities we serve. We work tirelessly to set and achieve ambitious biodiversity goals, striving to enhance the natural environment and thus uplift the quality of life within our society. In 2022, we embarked on a remarkable journey that brought these commitments to life and demonstrated the power of ingenuity and cooperation in preserving and protecting our natural heritage. This initiative was centered around one of the largest trees in the kingdom \u2018Sarh, Merro\u2019 which is estimated to be more than 100 years old. After recognizing the tree\u2019s irreplaceable value to the local ecosystem and to the heritage of our Kingdom, and in cooperation with the National Center for Vegetation Development and Combating Desertification, we devised a plan for the rescue of the tree. The visible roots of the tree were carefully covered, and rock beds were constructed around the tree, creating a protective barrier from potential threats in its surroundings. These measures aimed to secure the tree\u2019s health and longevity, allowing it to continue its vital role in the local ecosystem. This initiative is symbolic of our larger commitment to biodiversity and the environment. It represents the way we can and are making meaningful contributions to environmental preservation. Each effort, as seemingly small as protecting a single tree, reflects our understanding of our role in the greater ecological balance. This single tree is home to an abundance of life forms and its rescue can be considered an encouraging step in the fight against desertification, a significant environmental challenge in the Kingdom.Corporate Social Responsibility Initiatives",

The company conducts a meticulous analysis of identified sustainability-related risks using a matrix which effectively determines the risk score based on impact and likelihood. In addition to these operational enablers, risk culture plays an equally important role to integrate risk processes, procedures and build employee awareness throughout the organization. SEC conducts an annual Risk Appetite Leadership Workshop to educate its leadership on effective risk management practices. Furthermore, the company provides focused training to its employees on risk management principles through easy-to-understand examples.Risk Management Localization Financing DigitalizationSEC is committed to implementing and monitoring robust Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) practices, which are crucial in supporting the organization\u2019s pursuit of strategic goals and objectives.

Through comprehensive stakeholder engagement conducted throughout the year, the organization assessed the significance of the impact created on the environment, economy, and people due to its business activities. In addition, the impact of climate change on SEC was assessed to shape its business strategy. This engagement enabled SEC to identify relevant climate related risks and opportunities. Climate Opportunities* SEC has identified several climate-related opportunities with significant potential to influence its business strategically. One such opportunity stems from the SEC\u2019s initiatives focused on demand-side management (DSM). These initiatives are geared towards enhancing grid flexibility and promoting energy-efficient practices among consumers and businesses. By participating in DSM programs, consumers can not only reduce energy wasted but also realize tangible financial benefits through lower electricity bills. Moreover, involvement in DSM contributes to mitigating climate change by curbing overall electricity demand and emissions. The strategic impact of engaging in DSM initiatives is substantial. By optimizing energy usage and promoting demand response programs, SEC enhances grid reliability, which is essential for facilitating the transition to a low-carbon energy system. This strategic alignment positions the company as a proactive player in the transition to a more sustainable energy landscape while also ensuring competitiveness in an evolving market.Climate Risks* * This section includes interim climate related risks and opportunities identified by SEC. These are subject to change as SEC is in the process of finalizing the identification of climate related risks and opportunities. ** SEC categorizes risks and opportunities that may materialize in three time frames: short-term (around one year), medium-term (more than one year but less than long-term), and long-term (extended period, often several years).As SEC progresses on its journey to align climate-related disclosures with TCFD recommendations, the organization aims to report the financial impact analysis of climate risks and opportunities in future sustainability reports. This forward-looking approach underscores SEC\u2019s commitment to transparency, resilience, and sustainable business practices. Furthermore, SEC aims to conduct a comprehensive assessment of physical risks specific to its facilities and key transition risks that could impact operations, strategy, and financial planning. The company plans to undertake scenario analysis using plausible climate scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to assess the potential quantitative and qualitative impact of identified risks in the future. This analysis will enable SEC to develop a resilient climate strategy based on the impact that climate- related risks and opportunities have on its business operations and financial planning. The company has already started to actively address climate risk and seize opportunities through a defined decarbonization pathway. SEC is investing in renewable integration projects, prioritizing energy efficiency, and implementing technology solutions on the demand side to stabilize grid operations. Moreover, the company prioritizes fostering an informed and climate conscious workforce through ongoing training, development sessions, and capacity-building initiatives for employees and contractors throughout the year.

        "content": "Water Management SEC recognizes the importance of responsible water consumption, considering its operations in a water-stressed region of KSA and the dependency on water for operating steam-run power plants, cooling turbines, cleaning units, and boilers.1  Acknowledging the need for optimal use of water resources in line with the Kingdom\u2019s National Water Strategy and compliance with key regulations by Ministry of Environment, Water and Agriculture (MEWA), SEC is diligently promoting alternative water sources, including untreated seawater and treated sewage water. 2 The company is intensifying its desalination capabilities and designing specialized plants that can accept seawater as well as sewage water. As a result, it has reduced its reliance on freshwater. The ongoing development of a comprehensive water policy, targeted for publication by 2025, will further solidify SEC\u2019s commitment to rationalizing water use, setting discharge targets, and further promoting recycling and reuse. Through these measures, SEC aims to mitigate negative impacts on water resources and contribute to responsible water management. In 2023, the company\u2019s water withdrawal increased by 27.58% compared to last year owing to an increase in power generation. On the other hand, due to the implementation of effective resource management procedures through the environmental management system, a significant reduction of 94.32% in water consumption was achieved across sites. The company is committed to withdrawing minimal water from surface and ground since the Kingdom lies in an extremely water stressed region. In 2023, SEC revisited its calculation of water recycled or reused to align with the GRI standards and definitions. The metrics reported in previous years for water recycling represent the amount of water used for cooling that was treated and released back to the sea.Our Ambitions Publish Water Management Policy by 2025Progress as of 2023 In progress 1 Source: United Nations-Saline Water Conversion Corporation - When a region withdraws 25 per cent or more of its renewable freshwater resources it is said to be \u2018Water-Stressed\u2019 . 2 Source: National Water Strategy, Ministry of Environment Water & Agriculture . 3 Water reuse (also commonly known as water recycling or water reclamation) reclaims water from a variety of sources then treats and reuses it for beneficial purposes. Water reuse can provide alternatives to existing water supplies and be used to enhance water security, sustainability, and resilience. 4 In 2023, SEC revisited its calculation of water recycled or reused to align with the GRI requirements and definitions. While the company did not recycle or reuse water this year, the metrics reported in the previous years represented the amount of water used for cooling that was treated and released back to the sea. 5 Within this, the total quantity of water discharged through an approved third party is 9,066 Megalitres (2023).Water Withdrawn, Consumed and Discharged (Megaliters) Category 2020 2021 2022 2023 Water Withdrawn 8,999,671 6,403,192 7,386,170 9,422,926 Sea Water 8,517,451 5,824,858 6,750,430 9,413,288 Surface Water - - - - Ground Water 0 0 0 1,222 Third Party Water 482,220 578,334 635,740 8,416 Water Withdrawn From Water Stressed Areas 8,999,671 6,403,192 7,386,170 9,422,926 Water Recycled or Reused38,513,296 5,646,325 6,750,250 04 Percentage of Water Recycled And Reused (%) 94.60% 88.18% 91% 0% Water Discharged 8,513,296 5,646,325 6,750,250 9,386,8365 Water Consumed (Withdrawn Less Discharged) 486,375 756,867 635,920 36,090 These improvements in SEC\u2019s water performance stem from the integration of advanced water treatment technologies and the continuous development of operational policies for effective water management.

Construction activities for power plants, electricity grid, and substations are meticulously approached with a focus on minimizing biodiversity impact. SEC\u2019s consideration extends to both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, closely aligning with Environmental Management System procedures such as \u201cEP08 Operational Planning and Control\u201d and \u201cEP06 Site Decommissioning & Rehabilitation Procedure\u201d . * Additionally, SEC is working on developing a new procedure that is focused on biodiversity rehabilitation and restoration. Rigorous Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) are conducted collaboratively with National Center for Environmental Compliance, ensuring responsible environmental management. In 2023, SEC conducted EIAs on 88 of its operational sites and 55 of these sites were approved from NCEC. These organizations are also supporting SEC to develop the biodiversity policy. The company has recognized 4 sites with biodiversity impact to disclose in this report: Qunfudah, Ushaiqer, Farasan Island and Egyptian Underwater Cable project. Pursuant to its endeavor of strengthening the natural ecosystems and surrounding biodiversity, SEC developed an environmental protection program outlining the biodiversity protection initiatives planned for 2024, including identification of operational sites close to or within protected or restored habitats that require streamlined efforts to minimize the impacts on biodiversity. SEC is currently in the process of implementing an \u2018Environmental Management System\u2019 . Furthermore, the company has pledged to plant 5 million trees by 2030 in collaboration with the National Center for Vegetation Cover Development & Combating Desertification.Our Ambitions Plant 5 million trees by 2030 Progress as of 2023 * ISO 14001:2015 - Internationally recognized standard for environmental management systems (EMS). It provides a framework for organizations to design and implement an EMS, and continually improve their environmental performance.Saudi Arabia is the fastest-growing electricity consumer in the Middle East, with a rapidly expanding network of power lines. Bird mortality through electrocution and collision has been recorded in the country across selected areas, affecting various species of birds, some of which are endangered species. In addition to the areas in which SEC operates, electrocution and collision cases have also been recorded on Farasan Island, which is considered one of the most important sites for migratory aquatic birds known for their diversity and uniqueness. In 2023, SEC conducted biodiversity impact assessment for 4 sites (2,840 hectares), out of 88 operational sites with biodiversity impact. Significant biodiversity impact was found in all the 4 sites, however, SEC took prompt action and developed mitigation plans to address the risk to biodiversity impacted across these sites.  Key findings from the biodiversity impact assessments are captured in the tables below. Steppe Eagles and Egyptian Vultures are classified as endangered according to the IUCN, therefore holding high biodiversity value warranting concerted efforts to ensure the protection and preservation of these species. Thus, SEC collaborated with NCW to implement and finalize the installation of insulators on electric overhead lines to reduce the risk of electrocution and collision and ultimately protect birds in three areas where the company\u2019s power lines operate: Qunfudhah, Ushaiqer, and Farasan Island. Coral surfaces are also impacted by trenching operations for the electrical interconnection cable in the area between KSA and Egypt. As such, SEC adopted an alternative technology to protect the endangered coral reefs and ultimately reduce its impact on biodiversity. In addition to these four areas, affected bird species, mainly Steppe Eagles, have been recorded near the King Salman bin Abdulaziz Royal Natural Reserve where SEC\u2019s powerlines operate. The company plans to conduct an elaborate biodiversity assessment of this area in upcoming years to identify mitigation actions. The vast landscapes of Saudi Arabia are a vital part of our heritage. The Saudi Electricity Company is dedicated to minimizing its impact on these ecosystems and finding innovative solutions that promote a healthy balance between energy production and biodiversity protection.

During the subsequent six weeks following delivery, females are mandated to take their leave as they are strictly forbidden to work. To further support new mothers, an additional unpaid leave of one month is available, allowing them to navigate the initial challenges of parenthood. Recognizing the unique needs of some children, we extend a fully paid leave of one month for mothers with sick or disabled infants requiring continuous care, starting after the delivery leave period. This leave can be further extended for an additional month as needed. In parallel, acknowledging the crucial role of fathers, male employees are entitled to paternity leave of 3 working days to ensure their active involvement in the early stages of parenthood.

A steadfast power supply acts as a catalyst for economic development, supporting industrial growth, technological advancement, and overall productivity. SEC invests in robust and resilient infrastructure, incorporating regular maintenance, upgrades, and technology investments to minimize downtime and swiftly address any disruptions. Proactive measures, like predictive maintenance through advanced analytics and monitoring systems, enable the identification of potential issues before they escalate, contributing to higher availability rates. Transmission losses were significantly reduced to 2.53%, marking a notable improvement compared to the 2.70% recorded in 2022. This improvement can be attributed to the operational changes implemented in 2023, specifically the revised operational plan for available generation. These changes resulted in a decrease in the energy transmitted between operating areas, consequently leading to a reduction in technical losses in the tie lines between these areas for the year 2023. Distribution losses also witnessed a reduction from 9.42% in 2022 to 8.83% in 2023, attributed to the adoption of smart grid technologies and advanced conductors. Reliability metrics exhibited positive trends, with the System Average Interruption Duration Index (SAIDI) minutes improving by 7% compared to 2022 in both the distribution network. The System Average Interruption Frequency Index (SAIFI) in 2023 showed an improvement of 11% over 2022, demonstrating commendable progress.

This dedication is manifested through the assurance of an effective board, transparent committees, ethical operations, and responsible relationships with stakeholders such as suppliers and the community. SEC\u2019s comprehensive ESG strategy, endorsed by the Board, underscores the company\u2019s dedication to sustainability, responsible business practices, and the creation of long-term value, shaped by insights from internal and external stakeholder consultations, as well as investors\u2019 expectations. In alignment with its vision, objectives, and strategies, SEC is devoted to supporting the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030, by unlocking the potential for other revenue streams and being responsible in business.  While SEC is focused on transitioning towards a cleaner energy mix including the displacement of liquid fuel from its feedstock by 2030, the company is looking into adding new generation capacity from renewables through partnerships with the private sector. In addition, as the sole transmitter and distributor of electricity in Saudi Arabia, it has allocated substantial capital investment to upgrade the grid\u2019s infrastructure. SEC has started the roll out of 22 new renewable interconnection projects by 2025 with total renewable capacity of about 19 GW.  Almost 6 projects have been completed as of 2023. SEC aims to allocate 75% of total procurement spending to locally owned manufacturers by 2030 and has launched the \u201cBuild and Employ National Abilities\u201d (BENA) program focused on increasing localization in energy products, and the Saudi Skills Development Program which strengthens local suppliers, showcasing dedication to regional economic growth and future prosperity. SEC supports the Kingdom\u2019s Vision 2030 goal of being responsible in business by fostering excellence in governance. The dynamic approach taken by SEC considers all perspectives, maintaining alignment with the overarching business strategy. This is reinforced by executive-level governance and heightened accountability, collectively contributing to the cohesive and effective implementation of ESG initiatives.

SEC\u2019s commitment extends to the continuous refinement and improvement of governance structures, demonstrating its dedication to adaptability and responsiveness to the evolving landscape of corporate governance principles and industry standards, while implementing robust governance structures and policies which ensure ongoing accountability and oversight. Strategic ObjectivesDisclose transparently, openly and meaningfully through stakeholder dialogues Enhance coverage of code of conduct and ethics policies Informed decision-making through strong and unbiased governance SEC\u2019s responsible governance strategy revolves around three strategic pillars to ensure thorough implementation of initiatives. Firstly, transparent disclosures are ensured through regular engagement with stakeholders. Secondly, SEC seeks to enhance coverage of Code of Conduct and Ethics to ensure alignment with international best practices, conduct periodic reviews and keep updating the Code of Conduct and policies. Lastly, SEC ensures informed decision-making by planning to launch comprehensive employee governance awareness programs, coupled with an updated corporate governance manual. This chapter addresses key governance elements at SEC, including corporate governance, business ethics and integrity, emergency response planning, sustainable financial performance, data privacy, digitalization, research, development & innovation, and supply chain.Corporate Governance Strong and effective corporate governance helps cultivate a culture of integrity, transparency, compliance with laws and regulations and protection of shareholder rights. SEC recognizes that good corporate governance fosters ethical and sustainable business operations, providing the company with a competitive advantage in its opportunities. Effective corporate governance with strong board oversight ensures protection of shareholder rights, keeping the company\u2019s integrity intact. To ensure strong, transparent, and effective corporate governance, SEC\u2019s Policy, Criteria and Procedures for Board of Directors Membership outlines a comprehensive set of governance policies to be followed by the Board of Directors, Board Committees, and other key functions and personnel. These policies cover a wide range of key areas, including shareholder rights, board members\u2019 election and responsibilities, internal control systems, stakeholder engagement, disclosure, transparency, and more. The company has also established other policies that complement and reinforce its commitment to good governance. These include the Shareholders & General Assembly Rights Charter, as well as specific charters for the Board of Directors, Board Committees, and Executive Committee. To ensure that the governance standards are fully embraced and upheld throughout the Company, there is an Internal Governance function that operates under the Board Secretary. This function is responsible for ensuring the Board\u2019s governance and promoting awareness of the governance principles and policies. Furthermore, it serves as a key communication channel for the company\u2019s position on regulatory capital markets compliance and emerging governance trends. Strong corporate governance is fundamental to our success, ensuring transparency, accountability, and responsible decision- making. This trust-building foundation enables us to deliver reliable and sustainable electricity, contributing to a thriving energy sector and a prosperous nation.

The company acknowledges the importance of integrating sustainability into its business strategy and decision-making processes, generating enduring value for stakeholders. This strategic approach involves seizing opportunities in sustainability-related sectors such as renewable energy, energy efficiency, and distributed energy. Furthermore, modern, smart, and expanded grids are essential for a successful sustainable energy transition to a diverse clean power mix. additionally, as the economy moves to become more electric, the expansion and modernization of transmission and distribution will need to keep pace. SEC is scaling up grid investment against historical trends. this is expected to promote a positive growth outlook for SEC. 2 Economic Value Retained is the economic value generated by the company less the value distributed to the stakeholders.The company is witnessing sustainable growth in demand for electricity,  reflecting demographic and economic growth in the Kingdom under Vision 2030. Electricity consumption grew by 5% in 2023 compared to the previous year, with the company extending electricity services to more than 346,000 new  customers. Additionally, the transmission system customers\u2019  loads were higher and the backup capacity charges were  increased. The company continued to grow its subscriber  base for Dawiyat Integrated Company for Telecommunications and Information Technology  services and expand its  product offerings. These factors combined, in addition to new  revenue from development projects to construct substations  and transmission lines for the company\u2019s customers, contributed to a 4.50% increase in operating revenues in 2023  compared to the previous year, reaching 75.33 billion SAR  compared to 72.08 billion SAR in 2022. Net profit in 2023  amounted to 10.25 billion SAR compared to 15.14 billion SAR  in the previous year, reflecting a decrease of 32.30%, primarily attributed to increased operating and maintenance expenses due to business and asset growth, increased loads and increased maintenance programs, as well as higher financing costs and recording of non-recurring expenses. These factors were partially offset by higher operating revenues and a decrease in the provision for accounts receivable due to improved collection processes.SEC strives to balance financial success with environmental and social responsibility. Our strategic approach integrates sustainability seamlessly into our business decisions, creating long term-value for stakeholders. By seizing opportunities in sustainable sectors, we aim to foster a legacy where profitability coexists with a profound commitment to the well-being of our planet and society.

        "content": "The Government has historically been supportive in ensuring that SEC can adequately meet the electricity demands of the Kingdom. Such support by the Government currently includes a supportive regulatory regime and the provisioning of a balancing account. The supportive regulatory regime demonstrates the Government\u2019s continuous support to the electricity sector and its endeavors to raise the overall level of service to its citizens and residents across the Kingdom in line with Vision 2030 objectives. Since fiscal year 2020, the regulatory regime has recalibrated the way in which the Government provides support for SEC and has enacted the tariff balancing account. It compensates SEC for the difference between the regulatory-determined required revenue and the actual revenues that SEC generates from applicable tariffs to end consumers. Additionally, Dawiyat Integrated Company for Telecommunications and Information Technology (a wholly owned subsidiary of SEC) received government grant from Ministry of Communication and Information Technology for implementation of the fiber optic network as part of the national broadband initiative under Vision 2030. Customers benefit immensely from these combinations of financial support forms received by SEC. Such support enables SEC greater financial flexibility to invest in essential projects which helps raise the quality and reliability of service. This also helps the company keep pace with increase in demand for electricity in the Kingdom while fostering the widespread adoption of renewable energy, improving energy efficiency, and facilitating access to essential services. As a responsible electricity provider, SEC actively manages climate change risks and seizes opportunities. Embracing a holistic approach, SEC aligns near-term energy security with a steadfast dedication to long-term sustainability. Proactively exploring synergistic business models, the company strategically diversifies its portfolio into profitable sectors, including renewable energy, distributed energy, and demand side management. SEC has issued the first Green Sukuk out of the Kingdom and for a utility company in the Middle East region. It was the largest Green/ESG corporate issuance in the Kingdom in 2020. Further to this pioneering position and strategic move, in early April 2023, SEC bolstered its green financing mechanisms, emphasizing renewable energy opportunities and grid integration initiatives as well as promoting energy efficiency. SEC successfully completed a SAR 7.5 billion dual-tranche Sukuk issuance consisting of green and conventional tranches, under its international Sukuk program. The green tranche raised SAR 4.5 billion for a 10-year tenure and was based on SEC Green Sukuk Framework which was published in 2020 and covers two green projects under two distinct eligible categories with climate change mitigation co-benefits.
